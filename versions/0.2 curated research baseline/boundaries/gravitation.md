# Gravitation (G)

## Boundary Type
Ontic Boundary (Physical Constant)

---

## Boundary Statement

The gravitational constant defines a universal and unavoidable
coupling between mass–energy and spacetime structure.

Any model or derivation that assumes complete decoupling
of mass–energy from spacetime dynamics violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- the independence of physical systems
- the possibility of isolated mass–energy configurations
- the global structure of spacetime
- long-range interaction assumptions

It bounds the assumption of perfect isolation.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- No physical system with mass–energy can be fully isolated.
- Global effects cannot always be neglected without approximation.
- Certain idealizations (perfect inertial frames)
  are strictly local and approximate.

Explanations that ignore gravitational coupling
must explicitly justify their domain of validity.

---

## Relation to Models

This boundary applies across all physical models
that involve mass, energy, or spacetime.

Specific models (e.g. Newtonian gravity, general relativity)
instantiate this boundary differently,
but none eliminate it.

Models that treat gravity as negligible
do so only under explicit approximation.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not a modeling choice
- Not eliminable by scale separation
- Not removable by reformulation

If this boundary were removed,
the coherence of large-scale physical description
would collapse.

## Notes

This document treats gravitation
as a boundary of universal coupling,
not as a force law or geometric formalism.
