# Learning

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Psychological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The learning boundary defines a regime in which
psychological systems undergo durable internal change
as a consequence of experience, such that future
perception, cognition, emotion, or action
is systematically altered.

Any derivation or explanation that treats behavior
as fixed, purely innate, or instantly adaptable
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Learning expresses an irreducible necessity:

An organism must modify its internal organization
based on past interaction with the environment
in order to remain adaptive under changing conditions.

This necessity is independent of:
- learning mechanism
- representational format
- conscious intention
- rate of change

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations assuming static psychological structure
- treatment of adaptation as momentary adjustment
- claims of perfect or lossless memory
- models ignoring path dependence of experience

It bounds how experience-dependent change
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Past experience constrains future response.
- Learning introduces historical contingency
  into psychological explanation.
- Not all experience results in learning.
- Learning always involves trade-offs and forgetting.

Explanations that ignore learning
cannot account for skill acquisition,
habit formation, or behavioral change.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — noise, decay, and energetic cost
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on state granularity
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on feedback and reinforcement timing

These constants bound learning feasibility
but do not specify learning content or direction.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on perception, cognition, and emotion
  (experience must be perceived, processed, and valued).
- Precedes social learning and norm acquisition.
- Constrains agency
  by shaping preference and expectation over time.

Learning introduces durability
into psychological organization.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not instantaneous
- Not reversible without loss
- Not eliminable by intelligence or instruction

If this boundary is violated,
behavior is misrepresented as ahistorical.

## Notes

This document treats learning
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of experience-dependent psychological change,
not as a catalog of learning theories.
