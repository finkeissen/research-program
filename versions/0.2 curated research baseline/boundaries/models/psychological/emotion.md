# Emotion

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Psychological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The emotional boundary defines a regime in which
internal states assign value, urgency, and relevance
to perceived and cognitively processed information,
thereby modulating attention, learning, and action.

Any derivation or explanation that treats behavior
as driven solely by cognition or calculation
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Emotion expresses an irreducible necessity:

An organism must prioritize and evaluate situations
under conditions of limited time, information, and resources
to act adaptively.

This necessity is independent of:
- conscious awareness
- cultural expression
- specific affective categories
- neural implementation

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of behavior without valuation
- treatment of motivation as purely rational
- decision models ignoring urgency or affect
- learning models without reinforcement signals

It bounds how relevance and motivation
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Valuation precedes deliberation.
- Emotional modulation shapes attention and memory.
- Conflicting emotions generate indecision or instability.
- Absence of emotion implies paralysis, not neutrality.

Explanations that ignore emotional modulation
cannot account for motivation, aversion, or urgency.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — variability and energetic cost
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on response time
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on state resolution

These constants bound emotional responsiveness
but do not determine emotional content.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on cognition
  (evaluation of represented situations).
- Precedes decision and agency
  (valuation guides choice).
- Interacts with social models
  via shared and regulated affect.

Emotion provides the motivational gradient
within psychological explanation.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by rational control
- Not reducible to cognitive appraisal alone
- Not a noise term to be optimized away

If this boundary is violated,
behavior is mischaracterized as purely calculative.

## Notes

This document treats emotion
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of valuation and motivational modulation,
not as a taxonomy of feelings.
