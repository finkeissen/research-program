# Institutional Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Institutional / Social Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The institutional model defines a regime in which
rules, roles, and procedures create durable coordination
independent of individual intentions.

Any derivation or explanation that treats institutional effects
as reducible to individual choice alone violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- attribution of outcomes solely to individual agency
- explanations ignoring formal roles and procedures
- assumptions of ad-hoc coordination at scale
- interpretation of norms as mere preferences

It bounds how collective action can be coherently explained.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Roles matter independently of who occupies them.
- Rules persist beyond individual participants.
- Legitimacy conditions shape behavior alongside incentives.
- Collective outcomes cannot be inferred from intentions alone.

Explanations that ignore institutional structure
cannot account for stability, continuity, or authority.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model indirectly presupposes:

- Computational boundaries (formalization, procedure, record-keeping)
- Statistical boundaries (aggregation over populations)
- Temporal constraints (persistence across time)
- Physical constraints (communication, enforcement, storage)

No physical constant determines institutions;
they exist within multiple underlying boundaries.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on agency models
  (decision-capable actors).
- Constrains economic models
  (rules shape markets and exchanges).
- Enables large-scale coordination
  beyond biological or psychological limits.

Institutions transform individual actions
into structured collective behavior.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by better incentives
- Not reducible to psychology
- Not a mere convention without effect

If this boundary is violated,
concepts such as law, organization, and governance collapse.

## Notes

This document treats institutions
as boundaries on legitimate social explanation,
not as moral ideals or policy prescriptions.
