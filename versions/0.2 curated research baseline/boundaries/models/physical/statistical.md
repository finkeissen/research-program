# Statistical Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Statistical Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The statistical model defines a regime in which
individual microstates cannot be tracked or specified,
and only ensemble-level descriptions yield
stable, meaningful predictions.

Any derivation that treats macroscopic behavior
as directly deducible from single microstates
violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- reduction of macroscopic quantities to single states
- deterministic explanations of aggregate behavior
- direct interpretability of microscopic detail at scale
- reversibility assumptions in large systems

It bounds explanatory legitimacy, not microscopic dynamics.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Probability replaces certainty at scale.
- Macroscopic laws are emergent, not fundamental.
- Irreversibility appears as a statistical effect.
- Detailed micro-descriptions lose predictive relevance.

Explanations that ignore aggregation
cannot justify stable large-scale claims.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes and operationalizes:

- Boltzmann constant (k) — as the micro–macro boundary
- Planck constant (h) — limiting microstate resolution
- Speed of light (c) — constraining causal propagation

These boundaries define when statistical description
becomes necessary rather than optional.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Complements the quantum model by interpreting outcomes.
- Grounds thermodynamic descriptions.
- Applies to classical systems at large scales
  where detailed state tracking is infeasible.

The statistical model does not replace
microscopic models; it bounds their applicability.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by increased computational power
- Not removable by improved measurement
- Not a temporary epistemic shortcut

If this boundary is violated,
macroscopic prediction collapses into noise.

## Notes

This document treats the statistical model
as a boundary on legitimate large-scale explanation,
not as a lack of knowledge or approximation error.
