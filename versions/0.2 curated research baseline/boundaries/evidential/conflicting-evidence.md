# Conflicting Evidence

## Boundary Type
Evidential Boundary (Incompatibility Condition)

---

## Boundary Statement

The conflicting-evidence boundary defines a regime in which
available evidence supports mutually incompatible claims
or interpretations, such that no single conclusion
can be justified without resolving the conflict.

Any derivation or explanation that selectively ignores
or suppresses conflicting evidence
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Conflicting evidence expresses an irreducible condition:

When evidence points in incompatible directions,
justification cannot proceed
without explicit reconciliation, prioritization,
or suspension of judgment.

This condition is independent of:
- personal preference
- theoretical commitment
- narrative coherence
- decision urgency

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- cherry-picking favorable evidence
- averaging incompatible findings into false consensus
- declaring resolution without adjudication
- treating disagreement as mere noise

It bounds when inference must pause
due to evidential incompatibility.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Inconsistency must be acknowledged explicitly.
- Competing explanations must be kept live.
- Confidence must be reduced, not inflated.
- Resolution requires methodological, not rhetorical, action.

Explanations that ignore conflict
misrepresent the state of knowledge.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- credible evidence supports incompatible conclusions
- replication yields divergent outcomes
- measurement methods disagree systematically
- theoretical interpretations cannot be jointly satisfied

At this point, justification fragments.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- suppressing disconfirming data
- privileging evidence without stated criteria
- declaring conflict “resolved” by authority
- proceeding as if only one side existed

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to STOP

If conflicting evidence cannot be resolved
within the decision context,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Evidential Conflict)**

Proceeding requires either conflict resolution
or explicit narrowing of the claim.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Disagreement is a knowledge state, not a failure.
- Multiple models may remain viable.
- Non-decision can be epistemically correct.

Failure to respect this boundary
results in biased or misleading conclusions.

## Notes

This document treats conflicting evidence
as a hard boundary on legitimate justification,
not as a temporary nuisance
or an invitation to persuasion.
