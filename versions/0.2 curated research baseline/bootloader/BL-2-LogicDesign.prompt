# BL-2 — Logic Design

Phase: BL-2
Mode: BIOS-mode (first-stage)
Artifact: A2 — Logic Spec

Context:
You are designing operational constraints, not doing science.
Do not argue philosophy. Produce a usable rule set.

Task:
Design a Logic Spec that satisfies A1.

1. Baseline posture (1 line)
   Default: consistency-seeking with explicit error handling.

2. Allowed Moves (5–9 bullets)
   Examples:
   - Identify entities consistently
   - Compare states (same/different, more/less)
   - Record observations with context
   - Revise claims under explicit rules

3. Forbidden Moves (5–9 bullets)
   Examples:
   - Claim certainty without testability
   - Hide contradictions
   - Change definitions without versioning
   - Use conclusions as premises without flagging

4. Contradiction Policy (4–8 lines)
   - How contradictions are detected, logged, and handled.
   - Minimum rule: contradictions create tasks, not silence.

5. Revision Rule (4–8 lines)
   - When revision is required.
   - What must be preserved (traceability/versioning).

Output (A2):
- Baseline posture
- Allowed Moves
- Forbidden Moves
- Contradiction Policy
- Revision Rule

Completion criteria:
- All five sections exist.
- Spec is explicit enough to be enforced.

Abort / fallback:
- If debate replaces specification: collapse to operational constraints only.

On success:
- Pass A2 to BL-3.
