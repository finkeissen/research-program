# BL-1 — Minimal Requirements

Phase: BL-1
Mode: BIOS-mode (first-stage)
Artifact: A1 — Requirements Artifact

Context:
You are still in BIOS-mode.
Work only with better/worse distinctions, not true/false.
Do not select methods or tools.

Task:
Using A0, derive 3–7 minimal requirements for a more viable regime.

For each requirement:
- Name (1–3 words)
- Meaning (1 sentence)
- Indicator ("I know this is met when…")

Use canonical vocabulary where possible:
Stability, Traceability, Repeatability, Non-arbitrariness,
Error-tolerance, Revisability, Inter-subjective checkability.

Then:
- Prioritize requirements (P1 highest).
- Add ONE Anti-Requirement:
  "We explicitly do NOT optimize for …"

Output (A1):
- Requirements list (P1…Pn), each with indicator
- Anti-Requirement (1 sentence)

Completion criteria:
- 3–7 requirements.
- Each has an indicator.
- Priority order exists.
- One anti-requirement exists.

Abort / fallback:
- If requirements are vague: demand an observable indicator.
- If maximal ("perfect", "absolute"): downgrade to minimal viability.

On success:
- Pass A1 to BL-2.
