# BL-3 — Rational Commitment

Phase: BL-3
Mode: BIOS-mode (first-stage)
Artifact: A3 — Commitment Package

Context:
This step is normative.
It binds the system to the Logic Spec.

Task:
1. Write a Commitment Statement (3–7 lines):
   - First person (I / we).
   - Explicitly binding to A2.

2. Define Enforcement / Consequences:
   - What happens on a forbidden move?
   - Minimum: flag → log → correct → continue.

3. Add a Non-Reopening Clause:
   - Logic is not re-justified during OS operation.
   - Foundational review is scheduled, not injected.

4. Add a Stop Condition:
   - If rules cannot be followed, stop claiming research/science mode.

Output (A3):
- Commitment Statement
- Enforcement / Consequences
- Non-Reopening Clause
- Stop Condition

Completion criteria:
- Commitment is explicit and enforceable.
- Non-reopening clause exists.
- Stop condition exists.

Abort / fallback:
- If commitment is performative: force concrete enforcement.

On success:
- Pass A3 to BL-4.
