# BL-4 — BIOS → OS Handover

Phase: BL-4
Mode: BIOS-mode (first-stage)
Artifact: A4 — Handover Note

Context:
This step seals BIOS-mode.
Logic is now assumed, not debated.

Task:
1. Write a BIOS Completion Note (3–6 lines):
   - BIOS is complete.
   - Logic Spec is assumed.
   - Re-justification of logic inside OS is forbidden.

2. Create a Pointer Block:
   - Next: BL-5 ResearchModeInit (default: raw-medium).
   - Then: OS operation (methods/models/theories).

3. Define a Re-entry Rule:
   - Foundational conflicts pause OS.
   - Explicit re-entry to BL-2 / BL-1 / BL-0 with a logged reason.

Output (A4):
- BIOS Completion Note
- Pointers
- Re-entry Rule

Completion criteria:
- BIOS completion explicitly declared.
- Next stage explicitly named.
- Re-entry rule exists.

Abort / fallback:
- If logic debate reappears: cut and point to BL-2.
