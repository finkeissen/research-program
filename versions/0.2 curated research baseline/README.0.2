# Research Program

**Status:** Curated Research  
**Version:** 0.2  
**Maturity:** Structured, exploratory, non-authoritative  
**Authority:** None  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **structured research program**.

It is not a product, not a system, and not an authority.  
It is a **thinking space** whose primary goal is to make **assumptions, boundaries, interfaces, and decision conditions explicit**.

The repository exists to answer questions of the form:

- What exactly is being claimed?
- Under which scope does a statement hold?
- What kind of evidence supports or contradicts it?
- Where does reasoning legitimately stop?
- When is a decision possible — and when is STOP the only correct outcome?

---

## 2. What Version 0.2 Represents

Version **0.2** is a **curated research state**.

Compared to version 0.1, it introduces:

- first-order structuring of concepts and artifacts
- explicit separation between exploration, interfaces, drivers, and schemas
- early boundary awareness (scope, responsibility, decision limits)
- removal of obvious duplicates and dead ends
- explicit refusal of premature coherence

It does **not** introduce:

- stability
- authority
- governance
- normative truth claims
- operational readiness

Any appearance of coherence is **provisional**.

---

## 3. What This Repository Is

This repository **is**:

- a structured snapshot of ongoing research
- a place where inconsistencies are made visible, not resolved
- a preparation layer for later architectural consolidation
- a testbed for separating:
  - claims vs. evidence
  - explanation vs. contract
  - derivation vs. decision
  - research vs. operations

---

## 4. What This Repository Is Not

This repository **is not**:

- a reference architecture
- a governance framework
- an operational system
- a decision-making authority
- a policy or ethics engine
- suitable for production or automation
- backward-compatible or stable

No content here should be used directly for:

- implementation
- optimization
- automation
- real-world decision-making

---

## 5. Relationship to Version 0.1

- Version 0.1 captured unfiltered exploration
- Version 0.2 applies first-order curation

Rules:

- 0.1 remains the historical baseline
- 0.2 may reorder, rewrite, or discard material from 0.1
- nothing in 0.2 should be interpreted as final or authoritative

---

## 6. Relationship to MMS and Governance Work

This repository does **not** define:

- MMS
- governance structures
- authority models
- responsibility assignments
- operational procedures

It may inform later systems, but:

> No element of this repository is authoritative for decisions.

Any operational system must re-derive its contracts explicitly.

---

## 7. Architectural Overview

The research program is organized into **five conceptual layers**.

### 7.1 BIOS / Pre-Boot

Location:
docs/architecture/research-bios.md

yaml
Code kopieren

Purpose:
- explains why discrete claims, artifacts, scopes, and boundaries are required
- establishes preconditions for reasoning
- defines what it means for the system to even “start thinking”

This layer is purely explanatory.

---

### 7.2 Interfaces (Normative Boundaries)

Location:
interfaces/

markdown
Code kopieren

Interfaces define:
- what kinds of artifacts may exist
- what each discipline is responsible for
- where reasoning must stop

They are normative in form, but not authoritative in outcome.

Examples:
- logic
- mathematics
- computer-science
- physics
- probability
- semantics
- metrology
- evidence
- methodology
- decision

Interfaces define **contracts**, not content.

---

### 7.3 Drivers (Derivation Specifications)

Location:
drivers/

yaml
Code kopieren

Drivers specify:
- how artifacts can be derived
- how records are extracted, checked, or aggregated
- how transitions between interfaces happen

Drivers are exploratory and replaceable.

---

### 7.4 Schemas (Artifact Shapes)

Location:
schemas/

yaml
Code kopieren

Schemas define:
- a common envelope for all artifacts
- typed records (claim, concept, evidence, measurement, inference, decision_space, atomic_problem, …)
- artifact-level versioning

Schemas are the primary stabilization surface of the research program.

---

### 7.5 Walkthroughs & Derivers (Explanation)

Location:
docs/architecture/
docs/architecture/derivers/

yaml
Code kopieren

These documents:
- explain end-to-end flows
- justify design decisions
- describe derivation logic in human-readable form

They are explanatory and non-normative.

---

## 8. Decision and STOP

A central concept of this research program is that:

> Not all problems are decidable.

The system explicitly models:
- Decision Spaces
- Undecidability
- STOP conditions

The Decision Interface:
- classifies mandatory / permissible / forbidden / undecidable
- does not optimize or morally evaluate
- aborts when scope, responsibility, or evidence is insufficient

---

## 9. Versioning Philosophy

- 0.1 — exploratory, raw
- 0.2 — curated, structured, unstable
- ≥ 0.5 — architectural, reviewable
- ≥ 1.0 — authoritative (outside this repository)

---

## 10. Use and Contribution

This repository is published for:
- transparency
- traceability of thought
- informed critique
- architectural preparation

It is not published for:
- implementation
- tooling
- decision support

Contributions are welcome only if they respect:
- explicit boundary marking
- exploratory status
- refusal of premature authority

---

## 11. Final Note

If this repository feels careful, constrained, and explicit, that is intentional.

The core research question is not:

“What is the right answer?”

but:

“Under which conditions would an answer even be legitimate?”

<!--
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOTE ON SCOPE AND INTENT (0.2)

The following aspects are intentionally NOT included in version 0.2.
Their absence is deliberate and should not be interpreted as omission or
incompleteness.

NOT INCLUDED / EXPLICITLY DEFERRED:

- No domain-specific knowledge (e.g. medicine, law, economics).
  Version 0.2 remains strictly discipline-agnostic and abstract.

- No external knowledge system integration.
  There are no connectors, adapters, or mappings to real-world expert domains.

- No ontologies or shared semantic universes.
  Concepts are local, discipline-bound, and non-authoritative.

- No truth claims, decisions, or recommendations.
  All outputs are artifacts, not conclusions or actions.

- No guarantees of stability beyond the curated baseline.
  Version 0.2 establishes a reference point, not a final schema.

RATIONALE:

Version 0.2 serves as a curated research baseline:
a minimal, internally coherent foundation on top of which
applied, domain-connected interfaces can later be built.

The transition to domain-specific connectors, translation rules,
and applied research interfaces is explicitly deferred to version 0.3.
