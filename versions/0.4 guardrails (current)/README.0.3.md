# Phase 0.4 — Guardrails

**Epistemic Role:** System-wide guardrails  
**Authority:** None  
**Status:** Active (current phase)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Phase

Phase 0.4 defines **guardrails**.

Guardrails are **non-negotiable, system-wide boundaries** that protect the
**epistemic integrity and version identity** of this research program.

They do not guide reasoning, usage, or application.
They define **where this research program must stop**.

Phase 0.4 exists to make **STOP explicit, unavoidable, and visible**.

---

## 2. What Guardrails Are

A guardrail is a **version-defining limit**.

Guardrails:
- apply across the entire research program
- are domain-agnostic
- are not context-dependent
- are not provisional or replaceable within the same version
- define the conditions under which this version remains coherent

Guardrails cannot be violated.
They can only be **accepted** or **trigger a version transition**.

Violating a guardrail does not produce an error.
It produces **STOP**.

---

## 3. What Guardrails Are Not

Guardrails are **not**:
- constraints on use
- methodological frameworks
- evaluation or validation criteria
- best practices
- design principles
- recommendations
- contracts or handover rules
- product interfaces

Guardrails do **not**:
- assess correctness, quality, or performance
- compare alternatives
- justify decisions
- authorize actions
- optimize outcomes

Any document that evaluates, tests, validates,
or operationalizes content **does not belong to Phase 0.4**.

## 4. Core Guardrails of Version 0.4

### G1 — No Implicit Ontology
This research program must not introduce
implicit ontological commitments.

If a claim requires assuming what entities *are*
(rather than how statements, scopes, or structures are formed),
this version cannot proceed.

**Consequence:** STOP or explicit version transition.

---

### G2 — No External Empirical Grounding
This research program must not rely on
external empirical validation, measurement,
benchmarking, or real-world performance claims.

If a claim requires empirical evidence
to stabilize, justify, or compare outcomes,
this version cannot proceed.

**Consequence:** STOP or explicit version transition.

---

### G3 — No Authority Transfer
This research program must not transfer authority
to domains, models, tools, institutions,
or downstream systems.

If any artifact begins to function
as a decision authority, normative reference,
or operational mandate,
this version cannot proceed.

**Consequence:** STOP or explicit version transition.

---

### G4 — No Unmarked Version Drift
This research program must not evolve
through incremental extensions
that implicitly change its epistemic role.

If a change would alter:
- scope
- grounding
- authority
- decision relevance

without explicit re-versioning,
this version cannot proceed.

**Consequence:** STOP or explicit version transition.

---

## 5. Relationship to Constraints (Phase 0.3)

- Constraints restrict **use under conditions**.
- Guardrails restrict **meaningful continuation of the program**.

Violating a constraint invalidates an application.
Violating a guardrail invalidates the **version itself**.

Constraints may change within a version.
Guardrails may not.

---

## 6. STOP as a First-Class Outcome

STOP is a **valid, expected, and necessary outcome**.

STOP indicates that further progress would require:
- ontological commitments
- empirical grounding
- authority or responsibility assignment
- evaluation or validation
- or a change in epistemic role

STOP is not failure.
STOP is **structural honesty**.

---

## 7. Boundary of This Phase

Phase 0.4 ends where any of the following become necessary:

- external evaluation or benchmarking
- empirical validation or testing
- operational responsibility or liability
- contracts, handovers, or production interfaces
- claims that must be decided rather than bounded

Any such step lies **beyond Version 0.4**
and requires an explicit new version.

---

## 8. Summary

Phase 0.4 defines **where this research program stops**.

It preserves openness by refusing:
- implicit ontology
- hidden authority
- unmarked grounding
- silent version change

If this phase feels restrictive,
it is functioning exactly as intended.
