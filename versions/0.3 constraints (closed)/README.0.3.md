# Phase 0.3 — Constraints

**Epistemic Role:** Constraints on use  
**Authority:** None  
**Status:** Provisional, replaceable  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Phase

Phase 0.3 defines **constraints on use**.

It specifies **under which conditions structures, translations, or artifacts
may be used**, without asserting correctness, validity, or sufficiency.

This phase enables **conditional use without authority**.

---

## 2. What Constraints Are

A constraint is a **local, contextual restriction on use**.

Constraints:
- apply only under explicitly stated conditions
- are domain- or context-specific
- are provisional and replaceable
- may coexist with alternative constraints
- restrict *what may be done*, not *what may be thought*

Violating a constraint invalidates a **specific use**,
not the underlying structure and not the research program.

---

## 3. What Constraints Are Not

Constraints are **not**:
- principles
- axioms
- definitions
- guardrails
- validations
- recommendations
- decisions
- STOP conditions

Constraints do **not**:
- establish authority
- define truth or correctness
- impose system-wide limits
- prohibit lines of inquiry
- resolve competing interpretations

---

## 4. Relationship to Domains

Constraints may be **informed by domains** understood as interpretation spaces.

- Domains may motivate constraints.
- Any such relation must be **explicitly stated**.
- No constraint arises implicitly from domain content.

Domains themselves remain non-authoritative
and are not constrained by the existence of constraints.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Phases

### Relation to Phase 0.2 — Structural Extraction
- Constraints do not introduce new structures.
- They operate only on previously extracted structures.

### Relation to Phase 0.4 — Guardrails
- Constraints restrict **use**.
- Guardrails restrict **meaningful extension of the research program**.
- Violating a constraint invalidates an application.
- Violating a guardrail triggers **STOP or a version transition**.

---

## 6. Canonical Constraint Format

All constraints in this phase must be expressible in the following form:

- **Scope:** Where does this apply?
- **Condition:** Under which assumptions?
- **Restriction:** What is not permitted?
- **Status:** Provisional, non-authoritative

Any statement that cannot be expressed in this form
does not belong in Phase 0.3.

---

## 7. Explicit Boundary of This Phase

Phase 0.3 **ends** where:

- constraints would need to be non-negotiable
- restrictions would apply system-wide
- use-restrictions would turn into thought-restrictions
- epistemic integrity would require STOP

At that point, Phase 0.3 cannot proceed further.
The only valid continuation is **Phase 0.4 — Guardrails**.

---

## 8. Summary

Phase 0.3 enables **use under constraint**, nothing more.

It allows conditional, provisional application
while explicitly refusing validation, optimization, or authority.

If this phase feels narrow, cautious, or unsatisfying,
it is functioning as intended.

---

## Phase Status

Phase 0.3 (Constraints) is considered **closed**.

No new constraints should be added without reopening this phase.
Further restrictions that are non-negotiable or system-wide
belong to Phase 0.4 (Guardrails).

Reopening Phase 0.3 requires an explicit version decision.
