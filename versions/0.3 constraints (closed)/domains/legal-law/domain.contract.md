# Domain Contract — Legal Law

## Domain Name
Legal Law (Positive Law)

## Purpose
This domain connector provides a structured interface to **positive legal systems**:
statutes, regulations, case law, and formally recognized legal doctrines.

Its purpose is **not** to determine what is just, good, or optimal,
but to make **legal structures, constraints, and consequences explicit**
as research artifacts.

---

## Scope
This domain covers:

- positive law (statutes, regulations, binding norms)
- recognized legal interpretations (e.g. case law, precedents)
- jurisdiction-bound validity
- procedural and institutional constraints
- legally defined rights, duties, permissions, and prohibitions

The domain is strictly **jurisdiction-sensitive**.

---

## Provides
This domain connector may produce artifacts such as:

- structured representations of legal norms
- classifications of legal status (permitted / prohibited / mandatory)
- mappings between facts and legally relevant categories
- identification of jurisdictional scope
- detection of legal conflicts or ambiguities
- articulation of legally required procedures

All outputs are **contextual and conditional**.

---

## Refuses
This domain connector explicitly refuses to provide:

- moral judgments
- political recommendations
- policy optimization
- legal advice
- determinations of justice or fairness
- enforcement decisions
- responsibility attribution
- guarantees of legal correctness

The domain may return **STOP** when legal determination is not possible.

---

## Authority and Validity
Legal authority in this domain is:

- external to the research program
- derived from recognized legal sources
- bounded by jurisdiction, time, and interpretation

This domain does **not** create authority.
It only references and structures it.

Validity of artifacts depends on:
- clearly identified legal sources
- explicit jurisdiction
- temporal applicability
- stated interpretive assumptions

---

## Normativity
This domain is **explicitly normative**.

Normativity arises from:
- enacted rules
- institutional authority
- formal procedures

Norms are:
- not transferable across domains
- not elevated to general obligations
- not treated as moral imperatives

Legal normativity is **contained** within this domain.

---

## Uncertainty and Conflict
The domain explicitly models:

- ambiguous legal language
- conflicting norms
- unsettled jurisprudence
- discretionary interpretation
- jurisdictional overlap

Uncertainty is not resolved implicitly.
Conflicts may remain unresolved.

---

## Boundaries to Other Domains
This domain is **not** equivalent to:

- Politics (power, negotiation, legitimacy)
- Ethics (moral evaluation)
- Economics (efficiency, incentives)
- Sociology (social practice)
- Psychology (intent, cognition)

Any interaction with other domains requires
explicit translation and loss acknowledgment.

---

## STOP Conditions
This domain must return STOP when:

- jurisdiction is undefined
- applicable law is unclear or contested
- required facts are missing
- interpretation exceeds stated assumptions
- legal determination would imply responsibility or action

STOP is a valid and expected outcome.

---

## Revision and Change
Legal systems evolve.

Artifacts produced by this domain:
- may expire
- may require re-validation
- must state temporal assumptions

No artifact is stable by default.

---

## Status
This domain connector is:

- normative in structure
- non-authoritative in outcome
- research-oriented
- not suitable for legal advice or enforcement
