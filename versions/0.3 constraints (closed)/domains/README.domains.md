# Domains — Interpretation Spaces

This directory contains **domains as interpretation spaces**.

Domains in this research program are **not sources of authority** and **not decision spaces**.
They exist to host, contrast, and document **multiple possible interpretations** of a topic,
including competing models, teaching positions, assumptions, and open questions.

## 1. What Domains Are

A domain in this repository functions as an **interpretation space**.

An interpretation space:
- hosts **multiple, potentially incompatible viewpoints**
- makes assumptions and scopes explicit
- allows comparison, critique, and coexistence of positions
- supports exploration without requiring resolution

Domains are intentionally plural and may contain:
- different schools of thought
- common teaching positions
- simplified models
- historical or conventional framings
- unresolved tensions and contradictions

---

## 2. What Domains Are Not

Domains are **not**:
- authoritative knowledge bases
- validated models of reality
- operational specifications
- decision logic
- product-ready artifacts
- commitments to a single worldview

No content in this directory is suitable for:
- direct operational use
- automation
- optimization
- decision-making
- governance or policy enforcement

---

## 3. Relationship to Constraints and Guardrails

Domains may **inform** later phases of the research program,
but they do not determine them.

- Domains may **motivate** constraints defined in Phase 0.3.
- Any such transition must be **explicitly stated and traceable**.
- Constraints never arise implicitly from domain content.

Domains do **not** define guardrails.
All system-wide limits and STOP conditions are defined exclusively in Phase 0.4.

---

## 4. Teaching Positions and Conventional Views

Many domain texts reflect **teaching positions**, conventional framings,
or commonly used simplifications within a field.

Such positions are included for:
- transparency
- context
- critical examination

They carry **no authority** within this research program
and do not imply endorsement, correctness, or applicability.

---

## 5. Status and Use

All domain content is:
- **non-authoritative**
- **non-decisive**
- **contextual**
- **replaceable**

Domains exist to support research discourse.
They are not inputs to production systems.

Any system that uses insights from this repository
must explicitly re-derive its own assumptions, constraints, and responsibilities.

---

## 6. Summary

Domains are **places to think**, not places to decide.

They preserve plurality without enforcing consensus
and provide context without imposing authority.

If a domain appears incomplete, contradictory, or unsatisfying,
it is likely functioning as intended.
