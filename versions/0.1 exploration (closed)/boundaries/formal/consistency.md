# Consistency

## Boundary Type
Formal Boundary (Logical Validity)

---

## Boundary Statement

The consistency boundary defines a regime in which
a model, derivation, or set of claims must not
entail mutually incompatible statements
within the same scope and interpretation.

Any derivation or explanation that permits
simultaneous affirmation and denial
of the same proposition
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Consistency expresses an irreducible condition:

A system of claims is formally admissible
only if no statement and its negation
are both derivable under the same assumptions.

This condition is independent of:
- empirical adequacy
- plausibility
- usefulness
- explanatory power

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- models that tolerate internal contradiction
- reasoning that shifts assumptions implicitly
- explanations that rely on incompatible premises
- systems that trade consistency for convenience

It bounds when formal reasoning is legitimate at all.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Inconsistent systems can derive anything.
- Truth, falsity, and justification collapse under contradiction.
- Evidence cannot rescue inconsistency.
- Interpretation becomes arbitrary.

Explanations that ignore consistency
lose all discriminative power.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- a proposition and its negation are both derivable
- constraints imply incompatible requirements
- definitions produce circular negation
- scope is silently shifted to avoid contradiction

At this point, formal validity fails.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- tolerating contradiction “locally”
- postponing resolution indefinitely
- masking inconsistency with ambiguity
- appealing to usefulness over validity

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Other Formal Boundaries

- Presupposed by **axiom-dependence**
- Precedes **scope** determination
- Blocks **evidential evaluation** if violated

No evidential or operational reasoning
may proceed under inconsistency.

---

## Relation to STOP

If inconsistency cannot be resolved
by clarifying assumptions or scope,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Formal Inconsistency)**

No further derivation is permitted.

## Notes

This document treats consistency
as a hard boundary on formal admissibility,
not as a negotiable preference
or a trade-off against expressiveness.
