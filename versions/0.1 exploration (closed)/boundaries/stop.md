# STOP Boundary

## Boundary Type
Non-Model Boundary (Responsibility Limit)

---

## Boundary Statement

The STOP boundary defines the point at which
further modeling, derivation, or explanation
is no longer legitimate within the system.

Any attempt to continue formal reasoning
beyond this boundary violates responsibility constraints.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- continuation of derivation without sufficient grounding
- attribution of decisions to models or systems
- automation of judgment where responsibility is required
- substitution of explanation for accountability

It bounds the authority of the system itself.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Not all questions admit formal answers.
- Some decisions require human responsibility.
- Absence of sufficient evidence mandates non-action.
- Silence or refusal can be the correct outcome.

Explanations that ignore STOP
create false legitimacy and misplaced authority.

---

## Relation to Constants

This boundary is not derived from physical constants.

It may be triggered by:
- evidential limits
- computational undecidability
- model incompatibility
- ethical or responsibility constraints

STOP is a boundary of legitimacy,
not of physical possibility.

---

## Relation to Models

STOP applies to all models.

It is reached when:
- models yield conflicting requirements
- models exceed their declared domain
- models would imply irreversible harm
- no responsible attribution of outcome is possible

STOP terminates modeling,
it does not extend it.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not negotiable
- Not optimizable
- Not eliminable by more data or computation

If STOP is ignored,
the system ceases to be epistemically responsible.

---

## Notes

This document treats STOP
as the boundary that preserves responsibility
by preventing illegitimate continuation of formal reasoning.
