# Boltzmann Constant (k)

## Boundary Type
Ontic Boundary (Physical Constant)

---

## Boundary Statement

The Boltzmann constant defines the boundary between
microscopic descriptions of physical states
and macroscopic, statistical descriptions.

Any derivation that treats macroscopic quantities
as directly reducible to single microstates
violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- the direct interpretability of temperature
- the reduction of macroscopic observables to microstates
- the legitimacy of purely deterministic descriptions
  at large scales
- the transition from individual states to ensembles

It bounds description, not dynamics.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Temperature is a statistical quantity, not a property of a single particle.
- Macroscopic laws are emergent and probabilistic.
- Certain micro-level explanations do not scale to macro-level validity.
- Irreversibility appears as a boundary effect, not a fundamental asymmetry of microdynamics.

Claims that ignore statistical aggregation
cannot justify macroscopic predictions.

---

## Relation to Models

This boundary applies to all models
that connect microscopic states with macroscopic observables.

Specific models (e.g. classical thermodynamics,
statistical mechanics)
encode this boundary explicitly.

Models that treat macroscopic quantities as purely mechanical
must restrict their scope accordingly.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not a matter of convention
- Not eliminable by improved microscopic knowledge
- Not reducible to a single underlying trajectory

If this boundary were removed,
the distinction between state and ensemble would collapse.

## Notes

This document treats the Boltzmann constant
as a boundary of statistical description,
not as a scaling factor or unit conversion.
