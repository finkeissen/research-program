# Economic Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Economic Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The economic model defines a regime in which
resources are scarce, choices are mutually exclusive,
and allocation decisions generate opportunity costs.

Any derivation or explanation that assumes unlimited resources
or cost-free choices violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- assumptions of abundance or free availability
- simultaneous realization of incompatible goals
- explanations that ignore trade-offs
- valuation without reference to alternatives

It bounds decision legitimacy under scarcity.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Every allocation implies foregone alternatives.
- Value emerges from constrained choice, not from intrinsic properties.
- Optimality is always relative to objectives and constraints.
- Aggregate outcomes cannot be inferred from intentions alone.

Explanations that ignore scarcity
cannot justify economic behavior or outcomes.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model indirectly presupposes:

- Boltzmann constant (k) — energetic and entropic limits
- Speed of light (c) — temporal and coordination constraints
- Planck constant (h) — physical finiteness underlying resources

These boundaries ensure that scarcity is unavoidable,
not a modeling artifact.

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on biological models
  (needs, survival, reproduction).
- Requires computational constraints
  (bounded rationality, limited information).
- Uses statistical aggregation
  to describe markets and populations.

The economic model introduces explicit trade-offs
absent from purely biological description.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by efficiency improvements
- Not removable by coordination alone
- Not a moral or political stance

If this boundary is violated,
choice loses meaning.

---

## Notes

This document treats the economic model
as a boundary on legitimate allocation and choice explanations,
not as a specific market theory.
