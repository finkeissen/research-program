# Homeostasis

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Biological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The homeostatic boundary defines a regime in which
a living system actively maintains critical internal variables
within viable ranges despite external and internal perturbations.

Any derivation or explanation that treats biological stability
as passive persistence or equilibrium
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Homeostasis expresses an irreducible necessity:

A living system must regulate its internal conditions
to remain compatible with its own metabolic processes.

This regulation is not optional,
not incidental,
and not reducible to static balance.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of biological stability as equilibrium
- persistence without active regulation
- viability without feedback mechanisms
- treatment of fluctuation as mere noise

It bounds how biological stability can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Stability is an achievement, not a given.
- Regulation implies continuous sensing and response.
- Acceptable states form ranges, not points.
- Breakdown of regulation precedes structural failure.

Explanations that ignore regulation
cannot account for resilience or collapse.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — entropy production and dissipation
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on signaling and coordination
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on molecular interaction fidelity

These constants bound regulatory feasibility
but do not specify regulatory strategies.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds directly on metabolic processes
  (energy and material throughput).
- Precedes development and adaptation
  (which presuppose regulated internal states).
- Provides the biological basis
  for psychological stability.

Without homeostasis,
higher biological organization collapses.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to chemical buffering alone
- Not eliminable by structural redundancy
- Not replaceable by environmental constancy

If this boundary is violated,
the system loses biological viability.

## Notes

This document treats homeostasis
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of biological stability,
not as a description of specific regulatory mechanisms.
