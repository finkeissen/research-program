# Quantum Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Physical Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The quantum model defines a regime in which
physical quantities are fundamentally discrete,
measurement affects the system,
and certain properties cannot be simultaneously well-defined.

Any derivation or explanation that assumes
fully determinate, observer-independent microstates
violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- assumptions of continuous microstates
- simultaneous definiteness of conjugate quantities
- separation between system and measurement
- classical notions of trajectory and state

It bounds how physical reality at small scales
may be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Measurement outcomes are probabilistic.
- Certain quantities cannot be jointly specified.
- Observation is an interaction, not a passive readout.
- Classical intuitions about state and evolution fail.

Explanations that presuppose hidden,
fully determinate microstates
exceed the boundary of this model.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes and enforces:

- Planck constant (h) — as a lower bound on action
- Elementary charge (e) — as a unit of interaction
- Fine-structure constant (α) — as a coupling constraint
- Speed of light (c) — typically as a causal limit

These boundaries are not approximated away
but explicitly encoded.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Extends beyond the Newtonian model
  by abandoning continuous trajectories.
- Remains in tension with relativistic spacetime structure
  without additional assumptions.
- Requires statistical interpretation at the level of outcomes.

The quantum model is not a refinement of classical models,
but a boundary-induced reformulation.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not optional at small scales
- Not eliminable by improved measurement
- Not a matter of interpretation preference

If this boundary is violated,
predictions lose consistency with observation.

## Notes

This document treats the quantum model
as a boundary on admissible microphysical description,
not as a specific interpretation or formalism.
