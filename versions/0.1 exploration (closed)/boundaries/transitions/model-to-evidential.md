# Transition: Model → Evidential

## Transition Type
Boundary Transition (Explanatory → Justificatory)

---

## Transition Statement

This transition defines the point at which
a model, framework, or derivation
must submit its claims to evidential evaluation
in order to retain epistemic legitimacy.

Any derivation or explanation that remains
purely model-internal while making world-relevant claims
violates this transition.

---

## Purpose of the Transition

The purpose of this transition is to distinguish:

- internal coherence and explanatory structure
from
- justified claims about reality, action, or consequence

This transition prevents treating models
as self-validating or authoritative by construction.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The transition is triggered when at least one
of the following applies:

- the model makes empirical claims
- the model supports decisions or actions
- the model constrains responsibility or attribution
- the model is applied beyond purely formal analysis

At this point, evidential grounding becomes mandatory.

---

## Mandatory Conditions

To cross this transition, all of the following
must be satisfied:

- **Claim Extraction**  
  The model’s claims are explicitly stated and isolable.

- **Testability**  
  Claims admit possible evidential support or refutation.

- **Context Specification**  
  The evidential context and scope are declared.

- **Evidence Mapping**  
  Claims are linked to admissible evidence types.

Failure of any condition blocks the transition.

---

## Illegitimate Transitions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- treating internal coherence as evidence
- appealing to model elegance or authority
- exporting model implications without evidential link
- deferring evidence indefinitely

Such transitions must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Evidential Boundaries

This transition activates the evidential regime:

- Missing Evidence
- Weak Evidence
- Conflicting Evidence
- Indirect Evidence
- Evidence Threshold

No evidential boundary may be applied
before this transition is crossed.

---

## Relation to STOP

If a model cannot specify evidential conditions
or refuses evidential submission,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Model Not Evidentially Grounded)**

No claim export is permitted.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Models do not justify themselves.
- Explanation precedes but does not replace evidence.
- Authority shifts from structure to support.
- Claims become defeasible and revisable.

Any system that skips this transition
confuses understanding with justification.

---

## Notes

This document treats the transition
from model-based explanation
to evidential justification
as a hard epistemic boundary,
not as an optional validation step.
