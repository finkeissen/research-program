# Missing Evidence

## Boundary Type
Evidential Boundary (Absence Condition)

---

## Boundary Statement

The missing-evidence boundary defines a regime in which
a claim, inference, or conclusion cannot be legitimately
supported because required evidence is absent.

Any derivation or explanation that proceeds
as if absent evidence were implicitly present
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Missing evidence expresses an irreducible condition:

A claim cannot be epistemically justified
when no evidence exists that is capable of
supporting or falsifying it within the relevant context.

This condition is independent of:
- plausibility of the claim
- authority of the claimant
- internal coherence of reasoning
- urgency of decision-making

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- conclusions drawn without supporting data
- inference from silence or non-observation
- substitution of belief for evidence
- reliance on future or hypothetical data

It bounds when reasoning must halt
due to lack of evidential grounding.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
- Plausibility does not compensate for missing data.
- Coherent reasoning without evidence remains speculative.
- Action under missing evidence requires explicit acknowledgment.

Explanations that ignore missing evidence
cannot claim epistemic legitimacy.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- no empirical, observational, or documentary evidence exists
- existing data is irrelevant to the claim
- evidence cannot in principle be obtained
- evidence is inaccessible within the decision context

At this point, justification fails.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- treating lack of evidence as confirmation
- proceeding “for now” without marking uncertainty
- filling gaps with analogy or intuition
- deferring evidence requirements indefinitely

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to STOP

If missing evidence is essential
for decision, validation, or attribution,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Insufficient Evidence)**

No escalation or abstraction
can bypass this boundary.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Silence is not support.
- Suspension of judgment is correct.
- Explicit uncertainty is mandatory.

Failure to respect this boundary
results in unfounded claims.

---

## Notes

This document treats missing evidence
as a hard boundary on legitimate justification,
not as a temporary inconvenience
or rhetorical gap.
