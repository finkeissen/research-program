# Domain Interface Framework

This directory defines the **Domain Interface Framework** for version 0.3
of the research program.

The framework specifies **how real-world knowledge domains may be connected**
to the research program **without introducing authority, truth claims,
or implicit ontologies**.

It does not define domain content.
It defines **rules, obligations, and limits**.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Domain Interface Framework is to:

- allow applied, domain-connected research
- preserve epistemic discipline established in version 0.2
- prevent silent authority, hidden normativity, and semantic drift
- ensure comparability across heterogeneous domains

Domains are **connected**, not merged.

---

## What a Domain Is (in this Framework)

A domain is:

- a structured body of practice, knowledge, and conventions
- with its own assumptions, evidentiary standards, and limits
- operating under domain-specific norms

A domain is **not**:
- an authority
- a source of truth
- an ontology
- a decision engine

Domains produce **artifacts**, not answers.

---

## Obligations of Every Domain Connector

Every domain connector **must** explicitly define:

1. **Contract**
   - what the domain provides
   - what it refuses to provide
   - under which conditions artifacts are valid

2. **Primitives**
   - domain-specific terms and constructs
   - with explicit scope and meaning
   - without global semantic claims

3. **Boundaries**
   - non-goals
   - invalid inferences
   - known category errors
   - undecidable questions

4. **Translations**
   - how abstract research artifacts are interpreted in the domain
   - which mappings are allowed
   - which mappings are forbidden

Silence is not allowed.
Implicit assumptions are considered errors.

---

## Relationship to Core Interfaces (0.2)

The Domain Interface Framework:

- does not replace abstract discipline interfaces
- does not modify the envelope or schemas
- does not introduce new artifact authority

It operates **on top of** the curated research baseline (0.2).

Domains extend research outward, not upward.

---

## Normativity and Uncertainty

Domains may contain:
- normative rules (e.g. law)
- probabilistic reasoning (e.g. medicine)
- model-based assumptions (e.g. economics)

All such elements must be:
- explicitly marked
- scoped
- non-transferrable outside the domain

No domain-level norm propagates automatically.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

The Domain Interface Framework does not aim to:

- unify domains
- reconcile conflicting domain truths
- rank domains by authority
- automate decisions
- resolve ethical or legal responsibility

STOP remains a valid outcome.

---

## Status

This framework is:
- normative in structure
- non-authoritative in outcome
- experimental and extensible

It exists to make domain interaction **possible without collapse**.
