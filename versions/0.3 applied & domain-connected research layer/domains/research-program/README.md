# Domain — Research Program

This directory contains the domain connector for **Research Program**.
It follows the Domain Interface Framework defined in 0.3.

Each file specifies a distinct responsibility:
- Contract: what the domain provides and refuses
- Primitives: domain-bound terms and constructs
- Boundaries: explicit non-goals and STOP conditions
- Translations: controlled mappings to and from research artifacts
