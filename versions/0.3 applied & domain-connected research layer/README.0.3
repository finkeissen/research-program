# Research Program — 0.3  
## Applied Research Interfaces

Version 0.3 extends the *curated research baseline* established in 0.2
towards **applied, domain-connected research**, while preserving the
epistemic discipline and interface rigor of earlier versions.

This version does **not** replace 0.2.  
It builds on it.

---

## What 0.3 Is

Version 0.3 introduces **applied research interfaces**:
formalized connectors that allow the research framework to interact with
real-world knowledge domains (e.g. medicine, law, economics, engineering)
without collapsing into implicit ontologies, expert systems, or decision engines.

In short:

> 0.3 makes the research system *connectable* — not *authoritative*.

## What Changed Since 0.2

### From Curated Baseline → Applied Interfaces

| Aspect | 0.2 | 0.3 |
|------|-----|-----|
| Scope | Curated, internal | Applied, externally connectable |
| Domains | Abstract disciplines | Concrete expert domains |
| Interfaces | Baseline contracts | Domain connectors |
| Knowledge | Artifacts only | Artifacts + translations |
| Claims | Structured | Contextualized |

What remains unchanged:
- No truth claims
- No decisions or recommendations
- No implicit ontologies
- No hidden normativity

---

## Core Concept: Domain Interface Framework

At the heart of 0.3 lies the **Domain Interface Framework**.

It defines **how domains may be connected**, not *what they must say*.

Each domain connector is required to make explicit:
- its primitives and terms
- its boundaries and non-goals
- its translation rules
- its normative assumptions
- its uncertainty model (if applicable)

This framework exists to prevent:
- silent expert authority
- domain-specific truth inflation
- uncontrolled semantic drift

---

## Domains as Instances, Not Authorities

Domains such as medicine, law, or economics are treated as **instances**
of the domain framework.

They do not override:
- the envelope structure
- the artifact logic
- the discipline separation

No domain has special privileges.

A medical connector and a legal connector differ in content,
not in epistemic status.

---

## Relationship to the Boot Sequence

The boot sequence (BL2–BL5) remains the conceptual backbone:

- BL2–BL3: define internal research discipline and justification norms
- BL4: establishes handover contracts (now extended to domains)
- BL5: enables research mode with domain-aware drivers

Version 0.3 extends BL4/BL5 outward, not upward.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

Version 0.3 does **not** aim to provide:

- a unified ontology across domains
- automated decisions or recommendations
- expert systems or advisory engines
- domain-level truth validation
- stability guarantees for applied schemas

These exclusions are deliberate.

---

## Status of Version 0.3

Version 0.3 is:
- experimental
- extensible
- structurally constrained
- epistemically conservative

It is designed to scale across many domains
without losing the research character of the system.

---

## Looking Ahead

Future versions may:
- refine domain connector patterns
- introduce comparative domain analysis
- formalize cross-domain tensions and conflicts

But the core principle remains unchanged:

> The system produces **research artifacts**,  
> not answers.
