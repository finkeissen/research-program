# BIOS, Bootloader, Startup
## From Continuity to Formal Execution

This text provides an orientation for the transition
from continuous reality to formal, executable structure.

It does not define rules.
It explains boundaries.

---

## BIOS: The Pre-Formal Cut

The BIOS represents the necessary cut
between flowing reality and discrete information.

Before this cut:
- there are no units,
- no symbols,
- no problems.

The BIOS does not model the world.
It explains why modeling requires loss.

---

## Bootloader: The First Formal Commitment

The Bootloader is the first formal act.

It does not explain.
It declares.

With the Bootloader:
- discreteness is assumed,
- finiteness is enforced,
- relations become explicit.

From this point on,
everything that exists is representable as a PROBLEM.

---

## Startup: Entering Execution

Startup is not a concept, but a transition.

At startup:
- the MMS begins to operate,
- rules are enforced,
- failures become STOP conditions.

No interpretation remains.
Only execution.

---

## Separation of Roles

- BIOS explains why formalization is unavoidable.
- Bootloader defines the minimal formal universe.
- MMS executes within that universe.

These roles must not be mixed.

---

## Orientation Statement

> The BIOS justifies the cut.  
> The Bootloader commits to it.  
> The MMS enforces it.
