# Research Program

## Purpose

This repository defines an **epistemic research program**.

It does **not** generate knowledge, solutions, or content.  
It defines the **conditions under which knowledge claims, derivations, decisions, and actions are legitimate — or must stop**.

The research program precedes and constrains all downstream systems, including automated systems, models, and generators.

---

## What This Repository Is

- An epistemic **kernel**
- A system of **models, boundaries, transitions, and STOP conditions**
- A formalization of **when reasoning may proceed and when it must terminate**
- A normative constraint system for knowledge creation

This repository answers the question:

> *Under which conditions is it legitimate to derive, claim, decide, or act?*

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does **not**:

- generate domains, topics, or solutions
- contain factual knowledge bases
- optimize outputs
- implement algorithms or pipelines
- replace empirical research or expertise

Any repository or system that *produces* knowledge operates **downstream** of this one.

---

## Status

**Version:** `0.1`  
**State:** Epistemic kernel complete

Version `0.1` establishes:

- the complete model architecture
- all epistemic boundary types
- all mandatory transitions
- explicit STOP conditions

No operational or domain-specific policies are included at this stage.

---

## Core Architecture

The research program consists of four structural elements:

### 1. Models

Models define **irreducible explanatory regimes**, including:

- Physical
- Biological
- Psychological
- Social
- Agency
- Institutional

Models do not explain phenomena in detail.  
They define **what kind of explanation is admissible at all**.

---

### 2. Boundaries

Boundaries define **hard epistemic limits**.

They specify when reasoning becomes illegitimate due to:

- formal invalidity (e.g. inconsistency, scope violations)
- evidential failure (e.g. missing or conflicting evidence)
- computational infeasibility
- physical impossibility
- normative constraints (introduced in later versions)

Boundaries are non-negotiable.

---

### 3. Transitions

Transitions define **when and how movement between regimes is allowed**, including:

- model → model (e.g. psychological → social)
- model → evidential
- computational → physical
- evidential → STOP

If a transition cannot be satisfied, derivation must halt.

---

### 4. STOP

STOP is a **first-class outcome**, not an error.

STOP indicates that further reasoning, derivation, or action is **epistemically illegitimate** under current conditions.

Silence, non-action, or refusal are correct outcomes when STOP is reached.

---

## Relationship to MMS

This repository is **upstream** of the MMS (Modular Machine System).

- The research program defines **what MMS is allowed to do**
- MMS must not generate, derive, or assert anything that violates this program
- MMS may run technically without this repository
- It may **not** do so legitimately

In short:

> **MMS executes.  
> The research program legitimizes or stops execution.**

---

## Versioning Philosophy

- `0.1` — Epistemic kernel (this repository)
- `0.2` — Operational boundaries and action constraints
- `0.x` — Incremental formal refinement
- `1.0` — Stable, reviewable, reproducible epistemic system

Breaking changes are structural, not cosmetic.

---

## Edit Rules

- Structure takes precedence over content
- Boundaries and transitions must be explicit
- No silent assumptions
- No hidden defaults
- No implicit escalation

If a rule is not stated, it does not exist.

---

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for:

- epistemic grounding of automated systems
- research governance
- formal critique of derivations
- safety and legitimacy enforcement
- human and machine-readable constraint systems

It is intentionally austere.

---

## Final Note

This research program does not aim to be complete.  
It aims to be **correct where it speaks** and **silent where it must**.

Anything that proceeds without passing through these constraints  
does so **without epistemic authority**.
