# Evidence Threshold

## Boundary Type
Evidential Boundary (Sufficiency Condition)

---

## Boundary Statement

The evidence-threshold boundary defines the regime in which
available evidence is sufficient to legitimately support
a claim, inference, or decision within a specified context
and level of required certainty.

Any derivation or explanation that treats sufficiency
as absolute, context-free, or universal
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Evidence threshold expresses an irreducible condition:

Evidence is sufficient only relative to
the claim’s scope, the decision’s stakes,
and the consequences of error.

There is no context-independent notion
of “enough evidence.”

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- claims made without specifying required certainty
- escalation of evidential sufficiency across contexts
- reuse of evidence beyond its original scope
- treating provisional sufficiency as final truth

It bounds when justification may legitimately proceed.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Higher stakes require higher evidential thresholds.
- Exploratory claims require less evidence than decisive action.
- Sufficiency is revisable under new evidence.
- Evidence can be sufficient for one purpose and insufficient for another.

Explanations that ignore threshold relativity
misrepresent epistemic legitimacy.

---

## Threshold Determinants

The threshold is determined by:

- **Claim Scope**  
  How general or far-reaching the claim is.

- **Decision Stakes**  
  Cost of false positives and false negatives.

- **Evidence Quality**  
  Reliability, independence, and relevance.

- **Alternative Explanations**  
  Degree to which competitors are constrained.

No single factor is decisive alone.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- declaring evidence “settled” without context
- applying low-threshold evidence to high-stakes decisions
- masking uncertainty behind consensus language
- freezing thresholds against revision

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Other Evidential Boundaries

This boundary presupposes:

- absence of missing evidence
- sufficient strength (not weak)
- resolved conflict
- acceptable mediation depth

Violation of any prior evidential boundary
blocks threshold satisfaction.

---

## Relation to STOP

If the required threshold cannot be met
within the available evidence and constraints,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Threshold Not Met)**

Proceeding requires either more evidence
or explicit lowering of the decision scope.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Justification is always conditional.
- Closure is provisional, not final.
- Reopening is epistemically legitimate.

Failure to respect this boundary
results in premature closure or dogmatism.

## Notes

This document treats evidential sufficiency
as a boundary on legitimate justification,
not as a declaration of truth.
