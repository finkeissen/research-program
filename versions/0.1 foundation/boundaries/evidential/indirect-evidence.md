# Indirect Evidence

## Boundary Type
Evidential Boundary (Mediated Support Condition)

---

## Boundary Statement

The indirect-evidence boundary defines a regime in which
a claim is supported only through intermediary observations,
models, or inferences, rather than by direct observation
of the claimed phenomenon itself.

Any derivation or explanation that treats indirect evidence
as equivalent to direct evidence
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Indirect evidence expresses an irreducible condition:

Support for a claim may depend on chains of inference
whose validity relies on additional assumptions,
models, or background constraints.

This condition is independent of:
- plausibility of the mediating model
- historical success of similar inferences
- absence of direct counterevidence
- confidence of interpretation

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- conclusions drawn without direct observation
- inference chains with unexamined assumptions
- elevation of proxy measures to primary evidence
- claims whose support depends on fragile models

It bounds when mediation weakens evidential force.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Evidential strength decreases with inference depth.
- Failure of any link undermines the conclusion.
- Model dependence must be made explicit.
- Uncertainty accumulates across inference steps.

Explanations that ignore mediation
overstate evidential support.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- evidence relies on proxy variables
- observations support a model, not the claim directly
- causal chains are inferred but not observed
- measurement is separated from the phenomenon of interest

At this point, evidential force is conditional.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- treating proxies as observations
- collapsing model validation into claim validation
- ignoring assumption sensitivity
- presenting mediated inference as direct fact

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to STOP

If indirect evidence is the sole support
and the stakes require direct confirmation,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Indirect Evidence Insufficient)**

Proceeding requires either direct evidence
or explicit qualification of the claim.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Claims must track mediation depth.
- Confidence must reflect assumption load.
- Transparency about inference chains is mandatory.

Failure to respect this boundary
results in overconfident or fragile claims.

## Notes

This document treats indirect evidence
as a boundary on legitimate justification,
not as a dismissal of inference
or a denial of theoretical reasoning.
