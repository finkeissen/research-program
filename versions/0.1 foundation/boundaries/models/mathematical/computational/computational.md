# Computational Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Restricted Mathematical Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The computational model defines a regime in which
formal mathematical structures are required to be
effectively representable, finitely describable,
and executable through discrete, terminating procedures.

Any derivation that relies on infinite precision,
non-constructive existence, or unbounded execution
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Definition

Computation is understood as a constrained form of
mathematical derivation subject to strict operational limits.

It is not a claim about physical machines,
but about what kinds of formal processes
can be carried out in principle.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- use of infinite objects without finite representation
- reliance on non-constructive proofs
- procedures without guaranteed termination
- manipulation of continuous quantities
  without discretization

It bounds formal possibility by executability.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Not every mathematically well-defined problem is computable.
- Existence does not imply constructibility.
- Formal derivation must be stepwise and finite.
- Resource constraints are intrinsic, not incidental.

Claims that ignore these limits
cannot be operationally justified.

## Relation to Mathematical Model

The computational model is strictly contained within
the mathematical model.

All computations are mathematically definable,
but many mathematical structures
are excluded from computation by this boundary.

This boundary enforces the transition from
formal possibility to formal executability.

---

## Relation to Constraints

This model is governed by non-negotiable constraints:

- **Finiteness** — all representations and executions are finite
- **Discreteness** — operations proceed in discrete steps
- **Decidability** — only problems with determinate outcomes apply

These constraints are constitutive,
not optional refinements.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Provides the formal basis for algorithmic reasoning.
- Precedes any physical realization of computation.
- Constrains statistical and decision procedures.
- Grounds the limits of automated systems (e.g. MMS).

The computational model does not assert
that all reasoning is computational.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by faster hardware
- Not expandable by abstraction alone
- Not bypassable by approximation

If this boundary is violated,
formal results lose operational meaning.

## Notes

This document treats computation
as a boundary on legitimate formal derivation,
not as an implementation detail or technological artifact.
