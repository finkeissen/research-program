# Interaction

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Social Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The interaction boundary defines a regime in which
the behavior of multiple agents becomes mutually contingent,
such that each agent’s actions are shaped by
the anticipated and observed actions of others.

Any derivation or explanation that treats social behavior
as a sequence of independent individual actions
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Interaction expresses an irreducible necessity:

When agents encounter one another repeatedly,
their actions cannot be understood without reference
to the presence, responses, and expectations of others.

This necessity is independent of:
- communication medium
- shared language
- explicit coordination
- cooperative intent

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of social behavior as isolated choice
- aggregation of actions without mutual reference
- models assuming full transparency of intentions
- treatment of social order as centrally planned

It bounds how interdependent behavior
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Meaning emerges through reciprocal action.
- Outcomes depend on mutual anticipation.
- Misunderstanding and conflict are intrinsic possibilities.
- Control over outcomes is distributed, not centralized.

Explanations that ignore interaction
cannot account for coordination failures,
escalation, or emergent patterns.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on signaling and response
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — noise and variability in behavior
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on state discrimination

These constants bound interaction feasibility
but do not determine interaction structure.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on psychological models
  (perception, cognition, emotion, learning).
- Precedes norms and roles
  (which stabilize interaction over time).
- Interacts with meaning
  (shared reference emerges from interaction).

Interaction is the minimal social boundary.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to individual intention
- Not eliminable by perfect information
- Not equivalent to communication alone

If this boundary is violated,
social phenomena collapse into individual psychology.

## Notes

This document treats interaction
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of interdependent social behavior,
not as a catalog of interaction types.
