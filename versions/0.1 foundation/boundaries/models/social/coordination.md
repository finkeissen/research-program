# Coordination

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Social Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The coordination boundary defines a regime in which
multiple agents achieve patterned, mutually compatible action
without requiring centralized control or complete agreement.

Any derivation or explanation that treats large-scale social order
as fully planned, explicitly commanded, or perfectly aligned
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Coordination expresses an irreducible necessity:

When multiple agents pursue actions in shared environments,
their activities must become mutually compatible
to avoid collapse, deadlock, or conflict.

This necessity is independent of:
- central authority
- explicit communication
- shared goals
- formal institutions

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of order as imposed design
- treatment of coordination as consensus
- assumptions of complete information
- models ignoring local interaction effects

It bounds how collective order
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Order can emerge without intention.
- Local rules can generate global patterns.
- Coordination tolerates error and deviation.
- Stability does not imply optimality.

Explanations that ignore coordination
cannot account for traffic flow, markets,
crowds, or distributed collaboration.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on synchronization and signaling
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — noise and fluctuation in behavior
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on state resolution

These constants bound coordination feasibility
but do not determine coordination outcomes.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on roles
  (positional differentiation enables coordination).
- Precedes institutional stabilization
  (formal rules crystallize coordination).
- Interacts with meaning
  (shared interpretation reduces coordination cost).

Coordination explains how social order scales.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to command or consensus
- Not eliminable by technology
- Not guaranteed to be efficient or fair

If this boundary is violated,
social order is falsely attributed to design alone.

---

## Notes

This document treats coordination
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of emergent social order,
not as a prescription for control.
