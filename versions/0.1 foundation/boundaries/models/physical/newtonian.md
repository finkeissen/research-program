# Newtonian Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Physical Approximation)

---

## Boundary Statement

The Newtonian model defines a regime in which
space and time are absolute,
velocities are small compared to the speed of light,
and quantum effects are negligible.

Any derivation applied outside this regime
violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- admissible velocity ranges
- treatment of time as universal
- neglect of relativistic effects
- neglect of quantum discreteness

It bounds the domain of validity of classical mechanics.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Predictions are valid only at low velocities
  and large action scales.
- Certain explanations fail at high speed,
  high precision, or small scales.
- Apparent determinism is a model artifact,
  not a universal property.

Claims that extrapolate Newtonian results
beyond their domain are illegitimate.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes the following boundaries:

- Speed of light (c) — treated as effectively infinite
- Planck constant (h) — treated as effectively zero
- Gravitation (G) — treated as weak and local

These are approximations, not eliminations.

---

## Boundary Status

- Explicitly model-dependent
- Valid only under stated conditions
- Collapses outside its regime

The Newtonian model is a controlled approximation,
not a fundamental description.

## Notes

This document treats the Newtonian model
as a boundary of valid classical derivation,
not as a universal law of nature.
