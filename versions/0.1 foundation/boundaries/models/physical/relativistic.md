# Relativistic Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Physical Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The relativistic model defines a regime in which
the speed of light is finite and invariant,
and spacetime structure constrains all causal relations.

Any derivation or explanation that assumes
absolute simultaneity or superluminal causation
outside this regime violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- assumptions of absolute time
- independence of spatial and temporal measurements
- causal ordering of distant events
- admissibility of instantaneous influence

It bounds how motion, causality, and interaction
may be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Simultaneity is frame-dependent.
- Causal structure is constrained by light cones.
- Certain intuitive explanations (instant action,
  global time ordering) are illegitimate.
- Observables depend on the observer’s state of motion.

Explanations that ignore observer-dependence
cannot claim universal validity.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes and explicitly incorporates:

- Speed of light (c) — as an invariant upper bound
- Gravitation (G) — in its geometric coupling form
- Planck constant (h) — typically neglected in classical relativity

The relativistic model enforces these boundaries,
rather than approximating them away.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Extends and corrects the Newtonian model
  where relativistic effects become non-negligible.
- Remains incompatible with quantum discreteness
  without additional modeling assumptions.

It is neither reducible to nor eliminable by
classical approximations.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not optional once relativistic conditions apply
- Not removable by coordinate choice
- Not a matter of interpretation

If this boundary is violated,
causal explanation loses coherence.

## Notes

This document treats the relativistic model
as a boundary on admissible causal and spacetime descriptions,
not as a collection of field equations.
