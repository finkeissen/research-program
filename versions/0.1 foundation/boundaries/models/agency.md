# Agency Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Agency / Psychological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The agency model defines a regime in which
systems are treated as decision-capable entities
that can select among alternatives and be held responsible
for the consequences of those selections.

Any derivation or explanation that attributes choice,
intention, or responsibility to systems without
decision capacity violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- attribution of intention and choice
- assignment of responsibility
- explanation in terms of reasons rather than causes
- interpretation of behavior as deliberate

It bounds when psychological explanation is legitimate.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Decisions are distinct from physical causation.
- Reasons are not reducible to efficient causes.
- Responsibility presupposes alternative possibilities.
- Prediction of individual decisions is inherently limited.

Explanations that collapse choice into mechanism
erase the conditions for responsibility.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model indirectly presupposes:

- Statistical boundaries (non-determinism at scale)
- Computational boundaries (bounded rationality, finite cognition)
- Biological boundaries (self-maintenance, viability constraints)
- Physical boundaries (causal and energetic limits)

No single physical constant suffices;
agency emerges at the intersection of multiple boundaries.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on biological models
  (organisms capable of regulation and learning).
- Requires computational constraints
  (limited memory, limited foresight).
- Interacts with economic models
  (choice under scarcity).

The agency model marks the boundary
where explanation shifts from description to attribution.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by increased causal detail
- Not reducible to optimization or computation
- Not a matter of subjective interpretation

If this boundary is violated,
concepts such as responsibility and decision collapse.

## Notes

This document treats agency
as a boundary on legitimate psychological explanation,
not as a metaphysical claim about free will.
