# Mathematical Model

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Mathematical / Formal Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The mathematical model defines a regime in which
objects, relations, and transformations are specified
purely formally and manipulated according to explicit rules.

Any derivation or explanation that assumes semantic meaning,
empirical truth, or physical existence from formal structure alone
violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- attribution of meaning to symbols without interpretation
- inference of empirical truth from formal consistency
- identification of formal existence with ontic existence
- application of results outside stated axioms and rules

It bounds what can be concluded from formal systems alone.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Consistency does not imply truth about reality.
- Existence in a formal system is not existence in the world.
- Results are conditional on axioms and inference rules.
- Different axiom systems yield incompatible but valid structures.

Explanations that conflate proof with evidence
exceed the legitimacy of mathematical reasoning.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes no physical constants.

It may reference constants symbolically,
but their meaning is not fixed by mathematics itself.

All physical interpretation enters only
through external boundary commitments.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Provides formal tools for physical, computational,
  and statistical models.
- Does not constrain reality directly,
  only permissible formal derivation.
- Requires evidential and model boundaries
  to connect to empirical claims.

Mathematics enables modeling;
it does not validate it.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by interpretation
- Not equivalent to logic-free reasoning
- Not a substitute for empirical grounding

If this boundary is violated,
formal elegance is mistaken for explanation.

---

## Notes

This document treats the mathematical model
as a boundary on legitimate formal reasoning,
not as a claim about the structure of reality.
