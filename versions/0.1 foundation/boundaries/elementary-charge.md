# Elementary Charge (e)

## Boundary Type
Ontic Boundary (Physical Constant)

---

## Boundary Statement

The elementary charge defines a minimum, indivisible unit
of electromagnetic coupling.

Any derivation or model that assumes arbitrarily divisible
electric charge violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- the divisibility of electric charge
- the continuity of electromagnetic interaction
- coupling strengths between charged entities
- assumptions of smoothly variable charge distributions

It bounds charge itself, not electric fields in isolation.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Electric charge is fundamentally discrete.
- Certain continuous field descriptions
  are approximations over many charge quanta.
- Explanations relying on infinitesimal charge transfer
  are illegitimate at small scales.

Counting, not continuity, is the primitive operation
at this boundary.

---

## Relation to Models

This boundary applies across all models
that involve electromagnetic interaction.

Specific models (e.g. classical electrodynamics,
quantum electrodynamics)
either approximate or explicitly encode this discreteness.

Models assuming continuous charge densities
must justify their scale of applicability.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not introduced by convention
- Not removable by refinement of measurement
- Not dependent on mathematical representation

If this boundary were removed,
the notion of minimal interaction would collapse.

## Notes

This document treats the elementary charge
as a boundary of interaction discreteness,
not as a coupling parameter or unit definition.
