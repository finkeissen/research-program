# Axiom Dependence

## Boundary Type
Formal Boundary (Foundational Dependency)

---

## Boundary Statement

The axiom-dependence boundary defines a regime in which
claims, derivations, or models are valid only relative
to explicitly stated axioms, primitives, or foundational assumptions.

Any derivation or explanation that treats conclusions
as axiom-independent or universally binding
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Axiom dependence expresses an irreducible condition:

No non-trivial formal system is self-justifying;
all derivations presuppose foundational assumptions
that delimit what can and cannot be derived.

This condition is independent of:
- empirical adequacy
- intuitive plausibility
- internal elegance
- practical usefulness

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- claims presented as absolute without stated axioms
- derivations that silently shift foundational assumptions
- comparisons between models with incompatible primitives
- conclusions exported beyond their axiom base

It bounds when formal validity
can be legitimately asserted.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Validity is always relative to assumptions.
- Different axiom sets yield different legitimate models.
- Disagreement may reflect axiom choice, not error.
- Hidden axioms undermine transparency and critique.

Explanations that ignore axiom dependence
misrepresent the scope of their conclusions.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- foundational assumptions are unstated or implicit
- conclusions exceed the stated axiom set
- incompatible axiom systems are conflated
- axioms are modified without revising derivations

At this point, formal legitimacy is compromised.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- presenting axiom-relative results as absolute
- importing conclusions across axiom boundaries
- masking axiom choice as necessity
- resolving conflict by suppressing assumptions

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Other Formal Boundaries

- Presupposes **consistency**
- Clarifies sources of **contradiction**
- Constrains **scope** of validity

Axiom dependence must be explicit
before evidential evaluation.

---

## Relation to STOP

If foundational assumptions cannot be stated,
or if conclusions rely on incompatible axiom sets,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Unresolved Axiom Dependence)**

No further derivation is legitimate.

## Notes

This document treats axiom dependence
as a hard boundary on formal legitimacy,
not as a weakness
or an invitation to relativism.
