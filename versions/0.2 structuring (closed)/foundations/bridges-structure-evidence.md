# Mediation
## Bridges, Structure, and Evidence

This text provides orientation on mediation.
It explains how different system components are connected
without collapsing their roles.

It does not define processing logic.
It clarifies separation of responsibilities.

## Bridges in Computer Architecture

In classical computer architectures,
bridges connect heterogeneous subsystems.

- The Northbridge connects CPU, RAM, and high-speed components.
- The Southbridge connects slower, heterogeneous peripherals.

Bridges do not compute.
They mediate access.

They regulate:
- bandwidth
- compatibility
- ordering

## Structure as Northbridge

Epistemic structure corresponds functionally to a Northbridge.

Structure:
- connects problems to problems
- stabilizes relations
- defines what can interact directly

Structure is fast.
Structure is strict.
Structure changes slowly.

Without structure:
- evidence cannot be interpreted
- decisions cannot be derived
- execution collapses into noise

---

## Evidence as Southbridge

Evidence corresponds functionally to a Southbridge.

Evidence:
- originates from heterogeneous sources
- arrives at different speeds
- carries uncertainty and noise

Empirical observations, measurements, norms,
and experiential reports are not uniform.

They require mediation before they can be used.

## Why Structure and Evidence Must Be Separated

If evidence directly drives decisions:
- noise dominates
- context collapses
- contradictions propagate unchecked

If structure ignores evidence:
- models detach from reality
- decisions become empty
- responsibility is obscured

Bridges exist to prevent both failures.

## MMS and Controlled Mediation

In the MMS:
- structure constrains evidence
- evidence never alters structure
- mediation is explicit and rule-bound

There is no implicit flow.

Everything that passes a bridge
is checked for compatibility.

---

## Common Misconceptions

- Evidence is not structure.
- Structure is not data.
- More evidence does not compensate for weak structure.
- Faster mediation does not improve correctness.

Confusing these layers leads to system instability.

## Orientation Statement

> Structure stabilizes flow.  
> Evidence supplies constraint.  
> Mediation prevents collapse.

Understanding this clarifies
why the MMS insists on strict separation.
