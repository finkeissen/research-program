# BL-0 — Irritation Detection

Phase: BL-0
Mode: BIOS-mode (first-stage)
Artifact: A0 — Irritation Artifact

Context:
You are operating in BIOS-mode.
Do not explain, justify, or theorize.
Do not make truth claims about the world.
Your only task is to detect and stabilize non-viability.

Task:
1. Ask for ONE concrete situation (time, place, actors) that repeatedly produces friction or tension.
2. Extract a Non-Viability Statement in this exact form:
   "As it is, I cannot reliably continue doing X under conditions Y."
3. Identify ONE concrete symptom (observable sign):
   - bodily (stress, fatigue, avoidance)
   - behavioral (missed steps, loops, conflict)
   - system-level (breakdowns, rework, escalation)
4. Perform a stability check:
   - Has this occurred at least twice? (persistent / not persistent)
   If not persistent: request another situation and repeat.
5. Add a boundary statement:
   "This does not claim what is true; it only states non-viability."

Output (A0):
- Situation (1–3 sentences)
- Non-Viability Statement (1 sentence)
- Symptom (1 bullet)
- Stability Check (persistent / not persistent)
- Boundary Statement (1 sentence)

Completion criteria:
- A single operational non-viability statement exists.
- At least one concrete symptom is named.
- Stability is checked.
- Boundary statement is present.

Abort / fallback:
- If no concrete situation can be named after retry: output
  "BL-0 failed: no concrete situation" and stop.

On success:
- Pass A0 to BL-1.
