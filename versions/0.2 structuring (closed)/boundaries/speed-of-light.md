# Speed of Light (c)

## Boundary Type
Ontic Boundary (Physical Constant)

---

## Boundary Statement

The speed of light defines a strict upper bound on the propagation
of causal influence and information.

Any derivation, explanation, or model that assumes
faster-than-light causation violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- causal ordering of events
- signal transmission
- simultaneity assumptions
- admissible spacetime structures

It does not bound motion as such,
but the transfer of information and influence.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- No absolute simultaneity.
- Causal relations depend on spacetime structure.
- Certain intuitive explanations (instant action at a distance)
  are illegitimate by construction.

Claims that require superluminal causation
cannot be considered valid explanations.

---

## Relation to Models

This boundary applies across physical models
that involve spacetime and causality.

Specific models (e.g. Newtonian, relativistic)
may approximate or reformulate it,
but none can violate it without loss of coherence.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not set by convention
- Not dependent on measurement precision
- Not revisable within physical theory

If this boundary were violated,
the notion of causal explanation itself would collapse.

## Notes

This document treats the speed of light
as a boundary of legitimate derivation,
not as a numerical parameter or historical discovery.
