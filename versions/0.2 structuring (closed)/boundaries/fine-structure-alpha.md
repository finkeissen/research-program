# Fine-Structure Constant (α)

## Boundary Type
Ontic / Structural Boundary (Dimensionless Constant)

---

## Boundary Statement

The fine-structure constant defines the intrinsic strength
of electromagnetic interaction relative to quantum action
and relativistic constraints.

Any derivation or model that assumes arbitrarily weak or strong
electromagnetic coupling violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- the relative strength of electromagnetic interaction
- the stability of atomic structure
- the scale at which perturbative descriptions remain valid
- the coherence of matter as electromagnetically bound systems

It bounds coupling strength, not fields or charges in isolation.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Atomic and molecular structures exist only within a narrow coupling regime.
- Many qualitative features of matter depend on α being neither too small nor too large.
- Explanations that vary electromagnetic strength freely
  lose contact with physically coherent structure.

α sets a structural condition for the existence of stable matter.

---

## Relation to Models

This boundary applies across all models
that involve electromagnetic interaction and quantum structure.

Specific models (e.g. atomic physics, quantum electrodynamics)
encode α explicitly.

Models that treat coupling strength as a free, unconstrained parameter
must justify their departure from this boundary.

---

## Boundary Status

- Dimensionless and unit-independent
- Not reducible to a choice of units
- Not eliminable by reformulation

If this boundary were substantially altered,
the existence of atoms and chemistry would be compromised.

## Notes

This document treats the fine-structure constant
as a boundary of structural coherence,
not as a numerical curiosity or adjustable parameter.
