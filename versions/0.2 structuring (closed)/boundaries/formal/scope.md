# Scope

## Boundary Type
Formal Boundary (Validity Domain)

---

## Boundary Statement

The scope boundary defines the domain within which
a claim, model, or derivation is valid, applicable,
and interpretable.

Any derivation or explanation that applies conclusions
outside their defined scope
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Scope expresses an irreducible condition:

Every claim is valid only relative to
specific assumptions, contexts, domains,
and levels of abstraction.

There is no scope-free validity.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- extrapolation beyond defined conditions
- reuse of results in incompatible contexts
- collapsing abstraction levels
- silent generalization from local cases

It bounds where conclusions
may legitimately be applied.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Validity is local, not universal.
- Changing scope changes truth conditions.
- Apparent contradictions often dissolve via scope separation.
- Precision requires explicit scope declaration.

Explanations that ignore scope
misapply otherwise valid reasoning.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- conclusions exceed stated assumptions
- abstraction levels are mixed
- contextual constraints are ignored
- results are generalized without justification

At this point, applicability fails.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- applying results “in general” without scope
- shifting context without revision
- masking scope limits as exceptions
- treating abstractions as concrete facts

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Other Formal Boundaries

- Complements **axiom dependence**
- Resolves apparent **contradictions**
- Presupposes **consistency**

Scope must be fixed
before evidential or operational reasoning.

---

## Relation to STOP

If scope cannot be specified,
or if a claim is applied beyond its scope,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Out-of-Scope Application)**

No further inference is legitimate.

---

## Notes

This document treats scope
as a hard boundary on applicability and interpretation,
not as a technical footnote
or a rhetorical caveat.
