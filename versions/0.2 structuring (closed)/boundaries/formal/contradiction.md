# Contradiction

## Boundary Type
Formal Boundary (Local Incompatibility)

---

## Boundary Statement

The contradiction boundary defines a regime in which
a specific proposition, constraint, or derivation step
is incompatible with another within the same
assumptions, scope, and interpretation.

Any derivation or explanation that allows
contradictory statements to coexist without resolution
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Contradiction expresses an irreducible condition:

A contradiction occurs when a statement
and its negation are both asserted
under identical premises and scope.

This condition is independent of:
- evidential strength
- practical utility
- interpretive charity
- downstream consequences

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- local derivations that negate prior commitments
- constraint sets that impose incompatible requirements
- definitions that imply their own negation
- explanations relying on mutually exclusive conditions

It bounds when a specific inference step
is formally invalid.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- A single contradiction can invalidate a derivation.
- Local inconsistency propagates globally if unchecked.
- Selective ignoring of contradictions destroys rigor.
- Resolution requires explicit revision, not omission.

Explanations that ignore contradiction
corrupt formal reasoning.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- a proposition P and not-P are both derivable
- constraints impose mutually exclusive states
- a rule negates its own applicability
- assumptions conflict without scope separation

At this point, the derivation step fails.

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- deferring contradiction resolution
- treating contradiction as “acceptable tension”
- isolating contradiction without formal justification
- continuing derivation past the conflict

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Other Formal Boundaries

- Instantiates violations of **consistency**
- Requires **scope** clarification for resolution
- May expose hidden **axiom dependence**

Contradiction detection is prior
to evidential or operational reasoning.

---

## Relation to STOP

If a contradiction cannot be resolved
by revising assumptions, definitions, or scope,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Formal Contradiction)**

No further inference is legitimate.

## Notes

This document treats contradiction
as a local but decisive boundary on formal validity,
not as a productive paradox
or rhetorical device.
