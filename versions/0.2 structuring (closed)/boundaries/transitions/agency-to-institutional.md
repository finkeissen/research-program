# Transition: Agency → Institutional

## Transition Type
Boundary Transition (Attributive → Formalized)

---

## Transition Statement

This transition defines the point at which
attributed agency is no longer treated as situational
or context-dependent, but is stabilized, formalized,
and generalized into impersonal rules, procedures,
and offices.

Any derivation or explanation that treats institutions
as mere aggregations of individual agency
violates this transition.

---

## Purpose of the Transition

The purpose of this transition is to distinguish:

- responsibility attributed to specific actors
from
- responsibility embedded in enduring structures

This transition prevents collapsing institutions
into psychology, intention, or ad hoc decision-making.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The transition is triggered when all of the following hold:

- agency attribution occurs repeatedly across cases
- similar decisions require consistent handling
- reliance on individual discretion becomes insufficient
- continuity beyond individual actors is required

At this point, formalization becomes necessary.

---

## Mandatory Conditions

To cross this transition, the following must be satisfied:

- **Abstraction**  
  Decisions are detached from particular individuals.

- **Generalization**  
  Rules apply across cases, not singular situations.

- **Stabilization**  
  Expectations persist beyond the presence of specific actors.

- **Impersonality**  
  Authority derives from position or procedure, not person.

Failure of any condition blocks the transition.

---

## Emergent Consequences

Once the transition is crossed:

- Roles become offices.
- Norms become rules.
- Sanctions become codified.
- Decision paths become procedural.

These consequences cannot be derived
from agency attribution alone.

---

## Illegitimate Transitions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- treating institutions as collections of intentions
- bypassing formal procedure via personal authority
- attributing institutional outcomes to single agents
- dissolving institutional responsibility into psychology

Such explanations must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Institutional Model

This transition enables activation of:

- `institutional.md`

Institutions presuppose agency,
but exceed it through formalization.

---

## Relation to STOP

If formalization fails,
or if authority remains purely personal,
institutional explanation is not legitimate.

In such cases:

→ **STOP (No Institutional Structure)**

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Authority becomes rule-bound.
- Responsibility becomes distributed and mediated.
- Continuity no longer depends on individuals.
- Legitimacy shifts from intention to procedure.

Any system that skips this transition
misattributes institutional power.

## Notes

This document treats the transition
from agency to institutional order
as a hard epistemic boundary,
not as a political or legal theory.
