# Transition: Evidential → STOP

## Transition Type
Boundary Transition (Justificatory → Termination)

---

## Transition Statement

This transition defines the point at which
evidential evaluation fails to support a claim,
decision, or continuation, such that
further derivation, action, or assertion
is no longer epistemically legitimate.

Any derivation or explanation that proceeds
despite evidential failure
violates this transition.

---

## Purpose of the Transition

The purpose of this transition is to distinguish:

- provisional uncertainty that allows continuation
from
- evidential failure that mandates termination

This transition prevents escalation of claims
in the absence of sufficient justification.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The transition is triggered when at least one
of the following evidential conditions holds:

- required evidence is missing
- available evidence is weak relative to stakes
- evidence is conflicting and unresolved
- support is indirect beyond acceptable depth
- the required evidence threshold is not met

At this point, continuation is illegitimate.

---

## Mandatory Stop Conditions

The following conditions **require STOP**:

- **Unresolvable Missing Evidence**
- **Persistent Evidential Weakness**
- **Unresolved Evidential Conflict**
- **Excessive Mediation Dependence**
- **Threshold Failure**

Any single condition is sufficient.

---

## Illegitimate Continuations

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- proceeding “for now” without justification
- lowering thresholds implicitly
- substituting confidence for evidence
- deferring resolution indefinitely
- reclassifying failure as uncertainty

Such continuations must be rejected.

---

## Relation to STOP

When this transition is activated:

→ **STOP (Evidential Failure)**

No further claim, decision, or derivation
may proceed without new evidence
or explicit scope reduction.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Silence is epistemically correct.
- Non-action may be mandatory.
- Suspension of judgment preserves legitimacy.
- Restart requires changed evidential state.

Any system that ignores this transition
produces unjustified outcomes.

---

## Notes

This document treats the transition
from evidential evaluation to termination
as a hard epistemic boundary,
not as a pragmatic inconvenience
or decision-theoretic preference.
