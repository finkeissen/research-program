# Transition: Psychological → Social

## Transition Type
Boundary Transition (Individual → Interpersonal)

---

## Transition Statement

This transition defines the point at which
psychological processes of multiple agents
become mutually referential and stabilize
into patterns that cannot be explained
by individual psychology alone.

Any derivation or explanation that treats
social order as a direct extension of
individual mental states
violates this transition.

---

## Purpose of the Transition

The purpose of this transition is to distinguish:

- internal psychological processes
from
- emergent interpersonal structures

This transition prevents the reduction of
social phenomena to cognition, emotion,
or learning of isolated individuals.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The transition is triggered when all of the following hold:

- more than one psychologically autonomous agent is present
- agents interact repeatedly over time
- agents adapt their behavior in response to each other
- expectations about others’ behavior begin to form

At this point, individual-level explanation becomes insufficient.

---

## Mandatory Conditions

To cross this transition, the following must occur:

- **Reciprocity**  
  Agents’ actions influence each other bidirectionally.

- **Expectation Formation**  
  Agents form anticipations about others’ behavior.

- **Stabilization**  
  Interaction patterns persist beyond single encounters.

- **Opacity**  
  Agents cannot fully access or control others’ internal states.

Failure of any condition blocks the transition.

---

## Emergent Consequences

Once the transition is crossed:

- Interaction becomes a system-level property.
- Meaning is partially shared, partially negotiated.
- Coordination problems arise that are not solvable individually.
- Norm-like regularities can emerge without explicit agreement.

These consequences are not derivable
from single-agent psychology alone.

---

## Illegitimate Transitions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- explaining norms as private beliefs only
- treating social order as aggregated cognition
- assuming shared meaning without interaction
- collapsing interaction into communication mechanics

Such explanations must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Social Models

This transition enables the activation of:

- `social/interaction`
- `social/meaning`
- `social/coordination`
- `social/norms`
- `social/roles`

These models presuppose the transition
and cannot be invoked before it.

---

## Relation to STOP

If interaction fails to stabilize,
or if agents remain fully isolated,
the social level is not reached.

In such cases:

→ **STOP (No Social Structure)**

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Social phenomena are emergent, not designed.
- Individual intention is insufficient for social explanation.
- Prediction becomes context-dependent and probabilistic.
- Responsibility begins to diffuse across agents.

Any system that skips this transition
misattributes social structure to individuals.

## Notes

This document treats the transition
from psychological to social explanation
as a hard epistemic boundary,
not as a gradual scaling of cognition.
