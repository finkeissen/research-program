## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Biological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The developmental boundary defines a regime in which
a living system undergoes structured, irreversible change
over time, such that earlier states constrain
the space of possible later states.

Any derivation or explanation that treats biological change
as fully reversible or order-independent
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Development expresses an irreducible necessity:

A living system does not merely persist,
but transforms in a path-dependent manner
that cannot be reset without loss of identity.

This necessity is independent of:
- organism complexity
- specific genetic mechanisms
- environmental constancy

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations that ignore biological history
- treatment of growth as mere scaling
- assumptions of reversibility in living change
- prediction models that neglect developmental stage

It bounds how biological change over time
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- History matters: identical states reached differently
  are not equivalent.
- Timing and sequence constrain future possibilities.
- Certain interventions are only meaningful
  at specific stages.
- Full state reconstruction from outcome is illegitimate.

Explanations that ignore developmental path
cannot account for differentiation or maturation.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — irreversibility and entropy flow
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on coordination across structure
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on molecular precision

These constants bound developmental feasibility
but do not determine developmental form.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on metabolism and homeostasis
  (viable, regulated persistence).
- Precedes reproduction
  (which presupposes a developed structure).
- Constrains psychological and social models
  via life-stage dependence.

Development introduces temporal asymmetry
into biological explanation.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to instantaneous state description
- Not eliminable by genetic specification alone
- Not bypassable by external control

If this boundary is violated,
biological identity collapses into mechanism.

## Notes

This document treats development
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of biological change over time,
not as a catalog of developmental stages.
