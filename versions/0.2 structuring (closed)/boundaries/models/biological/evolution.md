# Evolution

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Biological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The evolutionary boundary defines a regime in which
biological populations undergo heritable change
across generations, such that variation, persistence,
and differential continuation jointly constrain
long-term biological structure.

Any derivation or explanation that treats biological form
as fixed across generations
or change as purely individual
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Evolution expresses an irreducible necessity:

When reproduction involves imperfect inheritance
and resources are finite,
population structure must change over generations.

This necessity is independent of:
- specific genetic mechanisms
- modes of selection
- environmental stability
- timescale of change

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of biological diversity without generational change
- treatment of adaptation as purely individual learning
- assumptions of optimal or static biological design
- accounts of long-term persistence without variation

It bounds how biological change across generations
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Population-level explanation becomes unavoidable.
- Historical contingency constrains present structure.
- Optimality claims are always local and temporary.
- Exact prediction of long-term outcomes is illegitimate.

Explanations that ignore evolutionary dynamics
cannot account for diversity, robustness, or extinction.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — entropy, variation, and irreversibility
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on replication fidelity
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on population interaction and spread

These constants bound evolutionary dynamics
but do not determine evolutionary trajectories.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on reproduction
  (heritable continuity across generations).
- Precedes social and institutional models
  by shaping organismal capacities and constraints.
- Interacts with environmental and statistical models
  at the population level.

Evolution introduces long-term structural contingency
into biological explanation.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to individual behavior
- Not eliminable by design or optimization
- Not reversible without loss of historical structure

If this boundary is violated,
biological diversity collapses into static taxonomy.

## Notes

This document treats evolution
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of biological change across generations,
not as a specific evolutionary mechanism or theory.
