## Functional Layers of the Research Program (FP)

### Layer 0 — Reality Interface
Function:
- Interaction with reality
- Measurement, observation, effect
- No meaning, no interpretation

Admissible:
- signals
- measurements
- interactions

STOP if:
- meaning or intention is inferred here

---

### Layer 1 — Problem Articulation
Function:
- Explicit formulation of a problem
- Boundary definition
- Context declaration

Admissible:
- problem statements
- scope definitions
- constraints

STOP if:
- claims appear without problem assignment

---

### Layer 2 — Claim Formation
Function:
- Formulation of claims bound to a problem
- No validation, no ranking

Admissible:
- claims
- hypotheses
- propositions

STOP if:
- truth, correctness, or optimization is asserted

---

### Layer 3 — Structural Admissibility
Function:
- Formal checking of claims
- Layer discipline
- Transition control

Admissible:
- admissible
- inadmissible
- STOP
- Absence

STOP if:
- responsibility collapses into structure

---

### Layer 4 — Decision Attribution
Function:
- Explicit assignment of responsibility
- Human or institutional commitment

Admissible:
- decisions
- commitments
- mandates

STOP if:
- decisions are delegated to models or processes

---

### Layer 5 — Execution / Application
Function:
- Action in the world
- Irreversible effects

Admissible:
- actions
- implementations
- consequences

STOP if:
- execution claims epistemic authority

---

### Layer 6 — Audit / Reflection
Function:
- Ex post inspection
- Traceability
- Error visibility

Admissible:
- audits
- revisions
- withdrawals

STOP if:
- audit is used to retroactively justify decisions
