# VISUAL CONSTRAINTS
## Rules for Visual Representation of the Architecture

---

## Status

This document defines **constraints for future visualizations**.

It does not provide diagrams,
sketches,
or illustrative material.

No visualization is normative.
No visualization may introduce authority.

---

## Purpose

Visualizations may be used
to support orientation and inspection.

They must not:
- explain the system,
- justify the system,
- simplify epistemic constraints,
- or suggest resolution where none exists.

---

## General Constraints

Any visualization MUST:

- preserve separation between
  epistemic, operative, and instantiation layers,
- avoid implicit hierarchy unless structurally defined,
- make STOP visible as terminal and non-bridged,
- keep conflicts explicit and unresolved,
- allow absence and gaps to remain visible.

---

## Prohibited Visual Effects

Visualizations MUST NOT:

- imply completeness or closure,
- suggest optimal paths or flows,
- smooth conflicts into gradients,
- hide STOP behind annotations,
- collapse layers into a single plane,
- use icons or metaphors that imply agency,
  intention, or correctness.

---

## Arrows and Directionality

- Arrows MUST NOT imply causality
  beyond explicitly admissible relations.
- No arrow may cross a STOP boundary.
- Cycles must remain visibly unstable
  and non-resolving.

---

## The Münchhausen Bridge

If the self-application is visualized:

- it MUST be marked as **singular**,
- it MUST be marked as **structurally exceptional**,
- it MUST NOT be extended or replicated,
- it MUST NOT be depicted as stable or supporting.

The bridge exists only once.

No further bridge is permitted.

---

## Scale and Emphasis

- No element may be visually emphasized
  as central, foundational, or superior,
  except where explicitly defined by structure.
- Absence may occupy space.
- Silence may be shown as empty regions.

---

## Interpretation Guardrail

No visualization may be considered
an authoritative interpretation.

All diagrams are **auxiliary artifacts**.

If a visualization contradicts
the admissibility rules,
the visualization is wrong.

---

## Final Note

Visual clarity must never
come at the cost of epistemic honesty.

Where representation would mislead,
non-representation is required.
