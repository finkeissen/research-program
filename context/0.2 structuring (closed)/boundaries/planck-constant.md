# Planck Constant (h / ħ)

## Boundary Type
Ontic Boundary (Physical Constant)

---

## Boundary Statement

The Planck constant defines a lower bound on the action
with which physical processes can be meaningfully described.

Any derivation or model that assumes arbitrarily small,
continuous action violates this boundary.

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- the divisibility of physical processes
- the resolution of measurement and observation
- the continuity assumptions of classical descriptions
- the legitimacy of infinitesimal action

It bounds action, not energy or time in isolation.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Physical processes are not infinitely divisible.
- Certain classical limit arguments fail at small scales.
- Measurement necessarily disturbs the system being measured.
- Deterministic trajectories lose meaning below this scale.

Claims that rely on perfectly continuous micro-processes
are illegitimate beyond this boundary.

---

## Relation to Models

This boundary applies across all models
that describe physical interaction, measurement, or dynamics.

Specific models (e.g. classical mechanics, quantum mechanics)
either violate this boundary or explicitly incorporate it.

Models that ignore this boundary are approximations
with limited domains of validity.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not set by convention
- Not removable by improved instrumentation
- Not dependent on observer perspective

If this boundary were removed,
the distinction between possible and impossible measurements
would collapse.

## Notes

This document treats the Planck constant
as a boundary of legitimate physical description,
not as a calculational parameter or unit-conversion factor.
