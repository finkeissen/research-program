# Cognition

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Psychological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The cognitive boundary defines a regime in which
perceptual inputs are transformed, integrated,
stored, and manipulated to support inference,
prediction, and action selection.

Any derivation or explanation that treats cognition
as unlimited, perfectly rational, or noise-free
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Cognition expresses an irreducible necessity:

An organism must internally process perceptual information
under constraints of memory, time, and attention
to act coherently in a changing environment.

This necessity is independent of:
- representational format
- conscious awareness
- symbolic or sub-symbolic implementation
- learning mechanism

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- assumptions of complete information processing
- explanations relying on perfect rationality
- treatment of memory as unlimited or lossless
- inference models ignoring cognitive load

It bounds how mental processing
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Cognitive representations are partial and lossy.
- Inference is heuristic, not exhaustive.
- Errors and biases are intrinsic, not defects.
- Learning reshapes cognition but never removes limits.

Explanations that ignore cognitive constraints
cannot account for bounded rationality or systematic bias.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — noise, entropy, and variability
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on information granularity
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on processing and coordination speed

These constants bound cognitive feasibility
but do not specify cognitive content.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on perception
  (processed sensory input).
- Precedes emotion and decision
  (which depend on cognitive appraisal).
- Interacts with computational models
  via representability and processing limits.

Cognition mediates
between experience and action.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by intelligence or training
- Not reducible to computation alone
- Not equivalent to logical inference

If this boundary is violated,
mental processing is idealized beyond legitimacy.

## Notes

This document treats cognition
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of mental information processing,
not as a specific cognitive architecture.
