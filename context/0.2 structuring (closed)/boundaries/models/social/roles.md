# Roles

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Social Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The role boundary defines a regime in which
sets of normative expectations become
systematically associated with positions
that agents can occupy within a social structure.

Any derivation or explanation that treats social behavior
as governed solely by personal traits or momentary choice
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Roles express an irreducible necessity:

As social complexity increases,
expectations must be bundled and stabilized
independently of specific individuals
to enable coordination and continuity.

This necessity is independent of:
- formal appointment
- legal recognition
- individual competence
- conscious identification with the role

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of social order without positional expectations
- reduction of behavior to individual personality
- treatment of norms as uniformly applicable to all agents
- assumptions of full freedom of action in social contexts

It bounds how differentiated social expectations
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Behavior is evaluated relative to role occupancy.
- The same action can have different meanings
  depending on role context.
- Role conflict and role strain are intrinsic possibilities.
- Individuals can enact roles without endorsing them.

Explanations that ignore roles
cannot account for institutional continuity,
division of labor, or predictable interaction at scale.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on coordination and feedback
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — variability in role enactment
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on role discrimination

These constants bound role stability
but do not determine role content.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on norms
  (roles bundle normative expectations).
- Precedes coordination at scale
  (roles enable structured interaction).
- Constrains agency
  by shaping perceived responsibility and authority.

Roles provide structural differentiation
within social systems.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to individual choice
- Not eliminable by informal interaction
- Not dependent on explicit codification

If this boundary is violated,
social structure collapses into undifferentiated interaction.

## Notes

This document treats roles
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of positional expectation in social systems,
not as a theory of identity or status.
