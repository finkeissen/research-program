# Meaning

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Social Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The meaning boundary defines a regime in which
symbols, actions, and expressions acquire shared significance
through social use, interpretation, and stabilization.

Any derivation or explanation that treats meaning
as intrinsic to symbols or privately fixed by individuals
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Meaning expresses an irreducible necessity:

For coordination, normativity, and role enactment to persist,
agents must converge sufficiently on interpretations
of actions and symbols.

This necessity is independent of:
- formal language
- explicit definition
- universal agreement
- semantic precision

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of communication as signal transfer only
- treatment of meaning as purely subjective
- assumptions of perfect semantic alignment
- reduction of symbols to physical marks

It bounds how shared understanding
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Meaning is use-dependent and context-sensitive.
- Misunderstanding is structurally unavoidable.
- Semantic drift is intrinsic to social systems.
- Interpretation is always partial.

Explanations that ignore meaning
cannot account for misunderstanding,
symbolic conflict, or cultural change.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on interaction and feedback
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — noise and variability in interpretation
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on discrimination of symbols

These constants bound semantic stabilization
but do not determine meaning content.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on interaction and norms
  (meaning stabilizes through repeated use).
- Enables coordination and role enactment
  by reducing interpretive ambiguity.
- Precedes institutional codification
  (formal definitions fix meaning).

Meaning underlies all higher-level social structures.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not fixed once and for all
- Not fully controllable
- Not reducible to syntax

If this boundary is violated,
communication is mistaken for understanding.

## Notes

This document treats meaning
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of shared semantics,
not as a theory of language or symbols.
