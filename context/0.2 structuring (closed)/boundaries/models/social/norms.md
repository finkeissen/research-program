# Norms

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Social Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The normative boundary defines a regime in which
patterns of interaction stabilize into shared expectations
about appropriate, acceptable, or forbidden behavior,
independent of any single agent’s preferences.

Any derivation or explanation that treats norms
as purely private beliefs or explicit rules
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Norms express an irreducible necessity:

When interaction persists over time,
agents must form expectations about others’ behavior
in order to reduce uncertainty and coordination cost.

This necessity is independent of:
- formal enforcement
- moral justification
- explicit articulation
- universal agreement

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of coordination without expectation
- treatment of norms as mere opinions
- reduction of norms to laws or incentives
- assumptions of full compliance or consensus

It bounds how social regularity
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Norms exist even when violated.
- Awareness of a norm is not required for its effect.
- Sanctions may be implicit, delayed, or distributed.
- Normative stability can coexist with disagreement.

Explanations that ignore norms
cannot account for predictability, conformity,
or systematic deviation.

---

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on social signaling and feedback
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — variability and noise in compliance
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on discrimination of behavior

These constants bound normative stabilization
but do not determine normative content.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on interaction
  (repeated mutual contingency).
- Precedes roles
  (which bundle norms by position).
- Constrains agency
  by shaping perceived permissibility.

Norms stabilize social interaction
without requiring formal institutions.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to explicit rules
- Not eliminable by individual dissent
- Not dependent on centralized authority

If this boundary is violated,
social regularity collapses into unpredictability.

## Notes

This document treats norms
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of social expectation and regularity,
not as a moral or legal doctrine.
