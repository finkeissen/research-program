# Foundations

This directory contains foundational orientation texts.

They explain preconditions, boundaries, and structural correspondences
that help to understand the research program,
without defining or constraining its formal components.

The contents of this directory:

- do not introduce rules
- do not define entities
- do not justify the MMS
- do not participate in derivation or execution

They provide orientation only.

Foundations precede the Bootloader conceptually,
but are not consumed by the MMS.

They are part of the research program.
