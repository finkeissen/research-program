# Weak Evidence

## Boundary Type
Evidential Boundary (Insufficiency Condition)

---

## Boundary Statement

The weak-evidence boundary defines a regime in which
evidence exists but is insufficient in strength,
reliability, or relevance to legitimately support
the claimed inference or conclusion.

Any derivation or explanation that treats weak evidence
as decisive or conclusive
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Condition

Weak evidence expresses an irreducible condition:

Evidence may be present yet fail to justify a claim
because its probative force is too low
relative to the claim’s scope, stakes, or required certainty.

This condition is independent of:
- narrative coherence
- repetition of the evidence
- confidence of the source
- alignment with prior belief

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- conclusions drawn from small or biased samples
- reliance on anecdotal or uncontrolled observations
- inference from correlations without constraint
- overgeneralization from limited cases

It bounds when evidence must be judged inadequate
despite its existence.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Evidence strength must match claim strength.
- Weak evidence supports hypotheses, not conclusions.
- Accumulation of weak evidence does not guarantee sufficiency.
- Uncertainty must be explicitly retained.

Explanations that ignore evidential weakness
inflate confidence illegitimately.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This boundary is triggered when:

- evidence has low reliability or high noise
- sample size or scope is insufficient
- relevance to the claim is indirect
- alternative explanations remain unconstrained

At this point, justification is degraded.

---

## Illegitimate Responses

The following responses are explicitly forbidden:

- treating suggestive data as proof
- compensating weakness with rhetoric or authority
- ignoring uncertainty margins
- escalating weak evidence into certainty

Such responses must be rejected.

---

## Relation to STOP

If weak evidence is insufficient
for the required decision or attribution,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Evidential Insufficiency)**

Proceeding requires either stronger evidence
or explicit downgrade of the claim.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Claims must be proportionate to evidence.
- Confidence must track evidential strength.
- Suspension or limitation of claims is correct.

Failure to respect this boundary
results in overconfident inference.

## Notes

This document treats weak evidence
as a boundary on legitimate justification,
not as a reason for dismissal
or a prompt for persuasion.
