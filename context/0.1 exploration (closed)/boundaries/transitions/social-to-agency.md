# Transition: Social → Agency

## Transition Type
Boundary Transition (Structural → Attributive)

---

## Transition Statement

This transition defines the point at which
socially stabilized patterns of interaction, norms,
roles, and meanings are attributed to identifiable actors
as sources of action, responsibility, and accountability.

Any derivation or explanation that treats agency
as purely individual or purely structural
violates this transition.

---

## Purpose of the Transition

The purpose of this transition is to distinguish:

- social regularities and expectations
from
- attributed capacity to act, decide, and be held responsible

This transition prevents collapsing agency
either into private intention
or into impersonal structure.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The transition is triggered when all of the following hold:

- stable social expectations exist (norms or roles)
- actions are interpretable as choices within those expectations
- outcomes are attributable to identifiable actors
- deviations can be evaluated (praise, blame, sanction)

At this point, agency attribution becomes necessary.

---

## Mandatory Conditions

To cross this transition, the following must be satisfied:

- **Identifiability**  
  Actions can be linked to specific actors or actor-sets.

- **Alternativity**  
  More than one action was socially available to the actor.

- **Attribution**  
  Observers can reasonably assign authorship of action.

- **Evaluability**  
  Actions can be assessed relative to norms or roles.

Failure of any condition blocks the transition.

---

## Emergent Consequences

Once the transition is crossed:

- Responsibility becomes meaningful.
- Accountability can be assigned.
- Intentions become socially relevant.
- Sanctions and rewards gain legitimacy.

These consequences are not derivable
from social structure alone.

---

## Illegitimate Transitions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- attributing agency without social context
- dissolving responsibility into structure alone
- treating agency as absolute freedom
- assigning blame without viable alternatives

Such explanations must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Agency Model

This transition enables activation of:

- `agency.md`

Agency presupposes social structure
and cannot be invoked prior to this transition.

---

## Relation to STOP

If actions cannot be attributed,
or if no alternatives existed,
agency attribution fails.

In such cases:

→ **STOP (No Agency Attribution)**

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Agency is relational, not intrinsic.
- Responsibility is socially grounded.
- Intent matters only within normative context.
- Attribution is fallible and revisable.

Any system that skips this transition
misplaces responsibility or absolves structure illegitimately.

---

## Notes

This document treats the transition
from social structure to agency attribution
as a hard epistemic boundary,
not as a psychological assumption.
