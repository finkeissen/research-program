# Transition: Computational → Physical

## Transition Type
Boundary Transition (Executable → Realizable)

---

## Transition Statement

This transition defines the point at which
a computationally well-defined and executable process
can be legitimately realized in physical systems
under material, energetic, and temporal constraints.

Any derivation or explanation that treats
computational executability as sufficient
for physical realization
violates this transition.

---

## Purpose of the Transition

The purpose of this transition is to distinguish:

- what can be computed in principle
from
- what can be physically instantiated in the world

This transition prevents conflating
formal execution with material feasibility.

---

## Trigger Conditions

The transition is triggered when at least one
of the following is required:

- execution in physical hardware
- interaction with physical environments
- measurement, sensing, or actuation
- persistence across physical time

At this point, physical constraints become binding.

---

## Mandatory Physical Constraints

To cross this transition, all of the following
must be satisfied:

- **Energy Availability**  
  Required energy must be finite and physically accessible.

- **Time Feasibility**  
  Execution must complete within relevant physical timescales.

- **Material Realizability**  
  Required states must be representable in physical matter.

- **Signal Propagation Limits**  
  Coordination must respect finite transmission speeds.

- **Thermodynamic Consistency**  
  Entropy production must not violate physical law.

Failure of any constraint blocks the transition.

## Illegitimate Transitions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- assuming infinite precision hardware
- ignoring heat dissipation and noise
- abstracting away material degradation
- treating simulations as physical processes
- relying on unphysical synchronization

Such transitions must be rejected.

---

## Relation to Constants

This transition is bounded by fundamental constants:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on signaling and synchronization
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on state resolution
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — limits via entropy and noise
- **Gravitational constant (G)** — limits on scale and density

These constants jointly constrain
physical realizability of computation.

---

## Relation to STOP

If any physical constraint cannot be satisfied,
the correct outcome is:

→ **STOP (Physical Infeasibility)**

No idealization or abstraction
can bypass this boundary.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Computability does not imply realizability.
- Physical limits shape feasible computation.
- Scaling changes feasibility qualitatively.
- Simulation is not instantiation.

Any system that ignores this transition
confuses models with reality.

## Notes

This document treats the transition
from computational execution
to physical realization
as a hard epistemic boundary,
not as an engineering optimization problem.
