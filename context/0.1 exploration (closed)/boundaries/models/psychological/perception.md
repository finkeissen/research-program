# Perception

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Psychological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The perceptual boundary defines a regime in which
an organism does not access the environment directly,
but through structured sensory mediation
that selectively filters, transforms, and constrains input.

Any derivation or explanation that treats perception
as a transparent or veridical copy of reality
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Perception expresses an irreducible necessity:

An organism must construct usable internal representations
from limited, noisy, and incomplete sensory signals
in order to act.

This necessity is independent of:
- sensory modality
- neural implementation
- conscious awareness
- representational format

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations assuming direct access to the world
- treatment of perception as passive reception
- inference of objective structure from raw sensation
- models ignoring sensory limitation and distortion

It bounds how experiential access to reality
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Perceptual experience is structured and selective.
- Absence of perception does not imply absence of reality.
- Different organisms inhabit different perceptual worlds.
- Error and illusion are intrinsic possibilities.

Explanations that ignore perceptual mediation
cannot account for misperception, ambiguity, or bias.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on signal propagation
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on sensory resolution
- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — noise and variability in signal processing

These constants bound perceptual feasibility
but do not determine perceptual content.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on biological models
  (metabolism, homeostasis, adaptation).
- Precedes cognition and emotion
  (which operate on perceptual input).
- Constrains social interaction
  by shaping shared and divergent experiences.

Perception is the gateway
from environment to psychological process.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not eliminable by training or technology
- Not reducible to physical stimulus alone
- Not guaranteed to be accurate

If this boundary is violated,
experience is mistaken for reality itself.

## Notes

This document treats perception
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of experiential access to the world,
not as a theory of sensory mechanisms.
