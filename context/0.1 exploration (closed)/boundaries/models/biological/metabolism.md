# Metabolism

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Biological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The metabolic boundary defines the regime in which
a system must continuously transform energy and matter
in order to maintain its organization far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

Any derivation or explanation that treats a living system
as persistently organized without continuous throughput
of energy and material violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Metabolism expresses an irreducible necessity:

A living system must perform ongoing internal transformations
to counteract entropy increase and structural decay.

This necessity is independent of:
- specific chemical pathways
- energy sources
- organism complexity
- environmental niche

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations of life as static structure
- persistence without energy exchange
- biological function without material turnover
- reduction of living stability to mechanical equilibrium

It bounds how biological persistence can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Living organization is processual, not state-based.
- Structural identity depends on continuous replacement.
- Failure of metabolic throughput implies loss of viability.
- Exact long-term prediction of internal states is illegitimate.

Explanations that ignore metabolic necessity
cannot account for life–death distinction.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — entropy and energy distribution
- **Planck constant (h)** — molecular interaction limits
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on coordination and transport

These constants constrain metabolism
but do not determine its form.

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on physical and statistical models
  (energy, matter, entropy).
- Requires computational constraints
  (finite rates, discrete transformations).
- Precedes all other biological models
  (homeostasis, development, reproduction).

Metabolism is the minimal biological boundary.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not reducible to physical equilibrium
- Not optional for living systems
- Not eliminable by structural complexity

If this boundary is violated,
the system is no longer biologically viable.

## Notes

This document treats metabolism
as a boundary on legitimate biological explanation,
not as a catalog of biochemical mechanisms.
