# Adaptation

## Boundary Type
Model Boundary (Biological Framework)

---

## Boundary Statement

The adaptive boundary defines a regime in which
biological structures and behaviors exhibit
context-dependent functional fit relative to
environmental and internal constraints.

Any derivation or explanation that treats biological form
as universally optimal or purposefully designed
violates this boundary.

---

## Core Necessity

Adaptation expresses an irreducible necessity:

Given evolving populations and constrained environments,
functional compatibility must emerge locally
without guaranteeing global or permanent optimality.

This necessity is independent of:
- conscious intention
- teleological purpose
- maximal efficiency
- environmental stability

---

## What Is Being Bounded

This boundary constrains:

- explanations that equate adaptation with optimality
- attribution of purpose or foresight to biological change
- treatment of function as intrinsic rather than contextual
- assumptions of permanence in biological solutions

It bounds how biological functionality
can be coherently described.

---

## Epistemic Consequences

- Function is always relative to context.
- What is adaptive now may become maladaptive later.
- Trade-offs are unavoidable.
- Multiple viable solutions can coexist.

Explanations that assume global optimality
misrepresent biological robustness and diversity.

## Relation to Constants

This model presupposes:

- **Boltzmann constant (k)** — energetic trade-offs and entropy
- **Speed of light (c)** — limits on environmental interaction
- **Planck constant (h)** — limits on structural precision

These constants bound adaptive feasibility
but do not define adaptive success.

---

## Relation to Other Models

- Builds on evolution
  (adaptation emerges through generational change).
- Constrains psychological and social models
  by shaping organismal capacities.
- Interacts with economic models
  via trade-offs and scarcity.

Adaptation links biological structure
to environmental constraint.

---

## Boundary Status

- Not equivalent to design
- Not eliminable by optimization algorithms
- Not stable across contexts

If this boundary is violated,
biological explanation collapses into teleology.

## Notes

This document treats adaptation
as a boundary on legitimate explanation
of biological function,
not as a claim of purpose or perfection.
