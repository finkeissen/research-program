# Computation
## CPU, ALU and the Role of the MMS

This text provides orientation on computation as execution,
not as understanding.

It explains what the MMS does — and what it explicitly does not do.

## CPU: Execution Without Semantics

A Central Processing Unit executes instructions.

It does not:
- understand meaning
- evaluate truth
- assess relevance

It operates on:
- instructions
- registers
- control flow

Meaning exists only outside the CPU.

---

## ALU: Elementary Operations

The Arithmetic Logic Unit performs the simplest possible operations:
- comparison
- conjunction
- disjunction
- negation

The ALU does not know:
- why an operation is performed
- what the result signifies
- whether it is useful

It only guarantees correctness
relative to the instruction set.

---

## MMS: Formal Execution

The MMS corresponds functionally to a CPU in strict mode.

It:
- executes derivations
- enforces constraints
- applies STOP conditions
- fails closed

The MMS does not:
- explain results
- justify decisions
- optimize outcomes
- learn from experience

Execution is its only task.

---

## Derivers as Instruction Sets

Derivers correspond to instruction sets.

They define:
- which operations are permitted
- in which order they may occur
- under which conditions execution must stop

Different derivers:
- do not compete
- do not override each other
- operate sequentially on the same formal universe

---

## No Intelligence at the Execution Level

At the level of the MMS:
- there is no intelligence
- no creativity
- no interpretation

Any appearance of intelligence
is an emergent property of structure,
not of execution.

Confusing execution with intelligence
is a category error.

---

## Why This Matters

This distinction prevents:
- anthropomorphizing the MMS
- expecting judgment instead of enforcement
- blaming the system for structural limits

Responsibility remains outside execution.

---

## Orientation Statement

> The CPU executes.  
> The ALU computes.  
> The MMS enforces.

Understanding this keeps agency
where it belongs.
