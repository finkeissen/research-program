# Memory
## ROM, RAM, Cache — and their Epistemic Counterparts

This text provides orientation on different forms of memory
and their epistemic roles.

It does not define system behavior.
It explains expectations.

## ROM: Non-Negotiable Foundations

Read-Only Memory represents what is fixed at runtime.

In computer systems:
- ROM initializes the system
- ROM is not modified during operation
- ROM defines what *must* be assumed

Epistemic counterpart:
- BIOS
- Bootloader
- Axiomatic commitments

ROM corresponds to assumptions that:
- cannot be negotiated during execution
- cannot be adapted to context
- must remain stable for the system to function

Without ROM, no system can start.

## RAM: Active Problem Space

Random Access Memory represents the active working state.

In computer systems:
- RAM holds current processes and data
- RAM is fast but volatile
- RAM is cleared when execution stops

Epistemic counterpart:
- current PROBLEMS
- bound EVIDENCE
- derived DECISIONS

The problem space exists only:
- in a specific context
- at a specific time
- for a specific purpose

When execution stops, the context dissolves.

This is not loss.
It is the price of relevance.

## Cache: Acceleration by Assumption

Cache stores frequently used data
to accelerate access.

In computer systems:
- caches improve performance
- caches may become stale
- caches trade correctness for speed

Epistemic counterpart:
- heuristics
- habits
- intuitions
- default assumptions

Caches are useful.
Caches are dangerous.

They allow rapid response,
but risk inconsistency and bias.

## MMS and the Absence of Cache

The MMS has:
- no cache
- no heuristics
- no shortcuts

Every derivation:
- starts from explicit structure
- uses only bound evidence
- respects STOP conditions

This makes the MMS slower,
but epistemically reliable.

## Human Cognition and Cache Dependence

Humans rely heavily on cache-like mec
