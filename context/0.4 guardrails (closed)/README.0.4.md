# Research Program — Version 0.4 (Guardrails)

**Status:** closed  
**Role:** Epistemic guardrails  
**Superseded by:** Version 0.5 (stresstest)  
**Authority:** None  

---

## 1. Purpose of Version 0.4

Version **0.4** defines the **non-negotiable epistemic guardrails** of the research program.

It does not introduce new content, domains, or interpretations.
Instead, it establishes **hard boundaries** that protect the integrity
of the entire research architecture.

Version 0.4 answers the question:

> *Under which conditions must this research program stop?*

---

## 2. Guardrails vs. Constraints

A core distinction of this research program is the separation between:

### Constraints (Version 0.3)
- apply to *use*
- are conditional and contextual
- may vary by domain
- can be revised or replaced
- violation invalidates application, not structure

### Guardrails (Version 0.4)
- apply to the **research program itself**
- are system-wide and non-negotiable
- define version integrity
- enforce STOP conditions
- violation requires a **version transition**, not an extension

Guardrails protect the research program from
implicit authority, hidden normativity, and uncontrolled scope expansion.

## 3. STOP as a First-Class Concept

In version 0.4, **STOP** is elevated to a first-class structural element.

STOP is not:
- an error
- a lack of data
- a failure of reasoning

STOP is:

> **An explicit epistemic boundary beyond which further reasoning
> would violate the rules of this research program.**

Encountering STOP is a *successful outcome* of epistemic discipline.

## 4. Scope of Version 0.4

Version 0.4:

- does **not** introduce empirical claims
- does **not** rank evidence
- does **not** resolve conflicts
- does **not** generate decisions
- does **not** authorize downstream systems

It solely defines **where and why reasoning must halt**.

---

## 5. Relationship to Earlier Versions

- **0.1 — Exploration:** open search space
- **0.2 — Structuring:** extraction of stable forms
- **0.3 — Constraints:** conditional use boundaries
- **0.4 — Guardrails:** non-negotiable epistemic limits

Each version remains valid **in its own historical and architectural role**.
No version retroactively invalidates earlier ones.

---

## 6. Relationship to Version 0.5

Version **0.5 (stresstest)** builds *on top of* the guardrails defined here.

Version 0.4 is therefore **closed**, but **binding**:
- no future work may violate these guardrails
- all stresstests are evaluated against them

---

## 7. Final Note

Version 0.4 completes the **epistemic safety layer** of the research program.

It ensures that:
- no authority can emerge accidentally
- no operational success can overwrite epistemic limits
- no product can claim legitimacy by inheritance

Version 0.4 does not move the project forward.

It prevents it from moving **too far**.
