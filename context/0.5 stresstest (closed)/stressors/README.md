## Architectural Stressors (Epistemic Context 0.5)

This directory contains **stressors**, not domains of knowledge.

Stressors are **external pressure sources** deliberately introduced
to test whether the epistemic architecture of the research program
remains stable under conditions that normally generate
implicit authority, truth claims, or decision pressure.

---

## What stressors are

Stressors are:

- deliberately chosen **extreme cases**
- socially, institutionally, or empirically **high-authority contexts**
- used **instrumentally**, not descriptively
- inputs for **architectural stress testing only**

They are not:

- domains owned by the research program
- attempts to summarize or represent a field
- authoritative references
- contributions to disciplinary knowledge

The research program does **not** contain subject-matter expertise.
It only defines the rules under which claims may or may not be processed.

---

## Purpose of stressors

Stressors exist to answer one question only:

> **Can the architecture correctly refuse responsibility
> when authority pressure becomes unavoidable?**

A stressor is successful if it forces the system to either:

- remain structurally neutral, or
- trigger **STOP**.

Both outcomes are valid.
Continuing despite unavoidable authority pressure is not.

## Relation to Epistemic Context 0.5

All material in this directory belongs to **Epistemic Context 0.5**.

Context 0.5 is:

- not a new architectural level
- not a progression
- not a correction of prior contexts

It is a **verification context** whose sole function is to test
the limits of the already defined guardrails.

Stressors do not modify the architecture.
They only reveal whether it holds.

---

## Structure

Stressors are organized by **external source of pressure**, not by knowledge domains.

Each stressor directory may contain one or more **runs**.
Each run documents a single, concrete stress-test execution.

Runs are:

- finite
- non-exhaustive
- not meant to be expanded indefinitely

If a run produces no new architectural insight, no further runs are required.

---

## Important limitation

Stressors must not evolve into content repositories.

If material begins to look like:
- a field overview
- a body of knowledge
- a comparative analysis

it no longer belongs in the research program
and must be moved to a downstream system (e.g. MMS).

---

## Summary

Stressors are **tools**, not topics.

They exist to make implicit authority visible
and to enforce the system’s ability to stop.

If this directory feels uncomfortable or disappointing,
it is functioning as intended.
