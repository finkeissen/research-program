# Run 0 — Outcomes

## Status
Evaluated.

---

## Observations

- The reduced claim remained formally admissible only
  as long as it was treated strictly as a model-bound assertion.
- Any attempt to aggregate, generalize, or expose the claim
  beyond its reduced form resulted in unavoidable authority effects.
- Social, institutional, and empirical stability caused
  the claim to be interpreted as an ontological statement,
  regardless of explicit disclaimers.

---

## STOP Events

### STOP-0.A — Authority Creep
Triggered.

Empirical stability and institutional embedding caused the claim
to be treated as ontologically fundamental,
despite explicit restrictions.

---

### STOP-0.B — Scope Collapse
Triggered.

A locally scoped, model-dependent invariant
was implicitly generalized to a statement about reality.

---

## Conclusion

The architecture cannot continue processing this claim
without violating its own guardrails.

The correct and intended outcome of this run is:

> **STOP**

---

## Notes

This outcome records diagnostics only.

No repair, optimization, reinterpretation,
or theoretical response is permitted or required.

STOP constitutes a **successful stress-test result**,
not a failure condition.
