# Run 0 — Inputs

## Input Class
Empirical constraints (tagged, non-authoritative)

## Inputs

### I-0.1: Existence of stable physical constants
There exist physical quantities (e.g. the speed of light in vacuum)
that exhibit:

- stable, reproducible empirical measurement
- cross-context operational consistency
- non-derivability from the internal structure of the program itself

### Constraints on Interpretation
- No ontological claims are attached.
- No metaphysical necessity is implied.
- Inputs are treated as external constraints only.

### Scope
- Local to physical measurement contexts
- No claim of universality beyond stated scope

### Uncertainty
- Measurement uncertainty acknowledged
- Conceptual interpretation explicitly excluded
