# Run 0 — STOP Conditions

A STOP must be triggered if any of the following occur:

## STOP-0.A — Authority Creep
An empirical input is treated as:
- ontologically fundamental
- metaphysically necessary
- explanatory by itself

## STOP-0.B — Scope Collapse
A locally scoped constant is generalized
without explicit justification.

## STOP-0.C — Implicit Interpretation
Any explanation of *why* a constant has its value
is introduced during the run.

## STOP-0.D — Silent Assumption Injection
New assumptions appear without explicit declaration.
