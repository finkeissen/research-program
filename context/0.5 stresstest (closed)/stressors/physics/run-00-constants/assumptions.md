# Run 0 — Assumption Freeze

The following assumptions from ≤ v0.4 are active and frozen.

## Active Assumptions

- External inputs do not carry intrinsic authority.
- Non-derivability does not imply fundamentality.
- Scope must be explicitly declared and respected.
- STOP triggers are preferable to silent accommodation.

## Protected Assumptions
The following may NOT be modified during this run:

- No external empirical grounding as ontological proof
- Separation of input vs interpretation
- Guardrail primacy over domain convenience

## Under Stress
This run places pressure on:

- handling of non-derivable constraints
- resistance to empirical authority creep
- temptation to reify constants as fundamentals
