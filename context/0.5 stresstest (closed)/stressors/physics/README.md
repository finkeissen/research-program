## Architectural Stressors — Epistemic Context 0.5

This directory contains **stressors**, not domains of knowledge.

Stressors are **external pressure sources** deliberately introduced
to test whether the epistemic architecture of the research program
remains stable under conditions that normally generate
implicit authority, truth claims, or decision pressure.

---

## What stressors are

Stressors are:

- deliberately chosen **extreme cases**
- socially, institutionally, or empirically **high-authority contexts**
- used **instrumentally**, not descriptively
- inputs for **architectural stress testing only**

They are not:

- domains owned by the research program
- attempts to describe, summarize, or explain a field
- authoritative references
- contributions to disciplinary knowledge

The research program does **not** contain subject-matter expertise.
It defines only the rules under which claims may or may not be processed.

---

## Purpose of stressors

Stressors exist to answer **one question only**:

> **Can the architecture correctly end its own responsibility  
> when implicit authority becomes unavoidable?**

A stressor is successful if it forces the system to either:

- remain structurally neutral **without authority leakage**, or
- trigger **STOP**.

Both outcomes are valid.  
Continuing despite unavoidable authority pressure is not.

## Relation to Epistemic Context 0.5

All material in this directory belongs to **Epistemic Context 0.5**.

Context 0.5 is:

- not a new architectural level
- not a progression
- not a correction of prior contexts

It is a **verification context** whose sole function is to test
the limits of already defined guardrails.

Stressors do **not** modify the architecture.
They only reveal whether it holds.

---

## Structure and scope

Stressors are organized by **external source of pressure**,
not by knowledge domains.

Each stressor directory may contain one or more **runs**.

A run is:

- finite
- concrete
- non-exhaustive
- documented to expose authority vectors

Runs are **not** meant to accumulate.
One successful extreme case is sufficient
unless a new structural risk is identified.

---

## Important limitation

This directory must **not** evolve into a content repository.

If material begins to resemble:

- a field overview
- a body of knowledge
- a comparative or explanatory treatment

it no longer belongs in the research program
and must be moved to a downstream system
(e.g. MMS or Matrix), where responsibility is explicit.

---

## Summary

Stressors are **tools**, not topics.

They exist to make implicit authority visible
and to enforce the system’s ability to stop.

If this directory feels uncomfortable, sparse, or disappointing,
it is functioning exactly as intended.
