# research-architecture  
## Full Layered Epistemic Architecture (v5)

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the complete epistemic and operational architecture.

Layer 0 → legacy  
Layer 1 → research-program  
Layer 2 → MMS  
Layer 3 → Matrix  
Layer 4 → hypotheses  
Layer 5 → predictions  

Layer 6 → interpretation / application (external authority layer)

The purpose of this architecture is to:

- preserve structural invariance under scaling  
- prevent implicit authority transfer  
- guarantee STOP integrity  
- enforce strict problem-centric admissibility  
- explicitly localize authority outside the epistemic system  

This architecture does not define:

- truth  
- correctness  
- optimization  
- consensus  
- decision rules  
- policy  

---

# 1. Architectural Invariants

The system is governed by two non-negotiable invariants:

> (1) No epistemic element may exist without explicit problem binding.  
> (2) No structural representation may acquire authority by representation.

These invariants must remain stable under:

- domain multiplication  
- conflict proliferation  
- hypothesis scaling  
- prediction cycles  
- temporal expansion  
- multi-user operation  

If scaling requires epistemic mutation, hidden heuristics,
or authority shortcuts, the architecture fails.

# 2. Epistemic Infrastructure (Layers 0–5)

Layers 0–5 form a closed, non-authoritative epistemic system.

| Layer | Name | Function | Authority | Output |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | legacy | pre-formal archive | none | unresolved artifacts |
| 1 | research-program | epistemic admissibility | none | constraints + STOP |
| 2 | MMS | operational enforcement | none | structured records |
| 3 | Matrix | claim ledger | none | contingent artifacts |
| 4 | hypotheses | falsifiable propositions | none | versioned hypotheses |
| 5 | predictions | bounded projections | none | projections + evaluations |

No authority exists inside Layers 0–5.

# 3. Layer Definitions

---

## Layer 0 — legacy

- Stores unstable, rejected, or unresolved material.  
- No admissibility guarantee.  
- No operational enforcement.  
- No authority.  

Upward migration requires full re-entry at Layer 1.

---

## Layer 1 — research-program

Defines:

- admissibility rules  
- problem-binding requirements  
- guardrails  
- STOP conditions  
- non-transfer rules  
- conflict representation principles  

Does NOT:

- generate claims  
- evaluate truth  
- rank evidence  
- optimize structure  
- synthesize conclusions  
- produce decisions  

STOP is epistemic and propagates downward only.

---

## Layer 2 — MMS

Implements:

- claim registration  
- relation modeling  
- provenance tracking  
- temporal versioning  
- mechanical constraint enforcement  
- conflict marking  

MMS may only enforce constraints explicitly declared in Layer 1.

MMS cannot:

- infer legitimacy  
- prioritize  
- introduce heuristics  
- repair epistemic violations  
- generate authority  

Operational failures do not alter epistemic rules.

---

## Layer 3 — Matrix

A structured ledger containing:

- claims  
- relations  
- conflicts  
- provenance  
- timestamps  
- explicit problem references  

The Matrix:

- does not assert truth  
- does not resolve disagreement  
- does not converge positions  
- does not generate recommendations  

Artifacts are:

- contingent  
- revisable  
- historically bound  
- incomplete by design  
- non-authoritative  

The Matrix is not a knowledge base.
It is a structured representation of articulated claims under constraints.

---

## Layer 4 — hypotheses

Defines explicitly falsifiable propositions.

Each hypothesis must include:

- versioned identity  
- explicit falsification criteria  
- explicit problem binding  
- declared assumptions  

Falsification results in status update, not erasure.

Survival does not imply truth.

---

## Layer 5 — predictions

Defines bounded projections derived from hypotheses.

Each prediction must declare:

- referenced hypothesis  
- assumptions  
- scope  
- temporal binding  
- evaluation criteria  

Evaluation outcomes:

- produce records  
- do not validate structure  
- do not generate authority  
- do not stabilize hypotheses  

---

# 4. Failure Modes (Layers 0–5)

| Failure Type | Layer | Result |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Epistemic violation | 1 | STOP |
| Operational violation | 2 | error |
| Logical contradiction | 3 | representation |
| Hypothesis falsification | 4 | status update |
| Prediction mismatch | 5 | evaluation record |

No silent repair is permitted.

STOP propagates downward only.

---

# 5. Scaling Invariance (Layers 0–5)

The architecture must remain invariant under:

- increased domains  
- increased claim density  
- increased hypothesis count  
- increased prediction cycles  
- multi-user contribution  

Invariant conditions:

- no new epistemic norms  
- no hidden prioritization  
- no authority through volume  
- no structural shortcuts  
- no cross-layer reinterpretation  

If scale requires rule mutation, the architecture is invalid.

---

---

# Layer 6 — Interpretation / Application  
## (External Authority Layer)

Layer 6 exists outside the epistemic infrastructure.

It represents:

- human judgment  
- institutional decision-making  
- medical recommendation  
- legal conclusion  
- policy formation  
- operational action  

Layer 6 may consume:

- Matrix artifacts  
- hypotheses  
- predictions  
- provenance and evaluation history  

Layer 6 may produce:

- decisions  
- recommendations  
- policies  
- interventions  
- accountability  

These outputs are external to Layers 0–5.

If recorded internally, they must appear only as contingent claims:

"Actor X decided Y under context C at time T."

---

## Authority Localization

Authority exists only in Layer 6.

Layers 0–5 are structurally non-authoritative.

Authority must be:

- explicit  
- accountable  
- external  

---

## Non-Transfer Rule

Layer 6 MUST NOT:

- treat representation as endorsement  
- treat survival as truth  
- treat volume as relevance  
- reinterpret STOP  
- import global claims without re-entry  

There is no reverse authority flow.

Any modification of admissibility requires explicit re-entry at Layer 1.

---

# 6. Final Boundary Statement

This architecture exists to ensure:

> Claims can be handled without being silently transformed into authority.

Authority is possible — but only after the epistemic boundary.

If authority re-enters Layers 0–5 implicitly,
the architecture is invalid.
