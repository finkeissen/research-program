## Purpose of This Document

This document is **File 0** of the repository cascade
and serves exclusively as an **interface**:

- for human readers
- for AI systems as a navigation and translation aid

It does **not** explain what the project claims,
but **how it must be read**,
so that neutrality, productivity, and responsibility
are not conflated.

---

## Preliminary Note

This repository describes:

- **no finished world theory**
- **no truth machine**
- **no classical product**

It describes:
- a **fully neutral research program**
- a **concrete technical implementation**
- and a **productive, transparent result: the Matrix**

The Matrix is:
- not premature
- not authoritative
- not without alternatives

Anyone who disagrees with the MMS or the Matrix
is explicitly invited to **develop counter-designs**.

---

## Why This Project Is Unusual

Many systems implicitly follow the pattern:

> *Model → Explanation → Trust.*

This project deliberately refuses that pattern.

It strictly separates three layers that are often
implicitly or unnoticedly conflated:

- **Epistemic layer**  
*(What may be claimed at all? Under which conditions?)*  
→ realized in the **research-program**  
→ fully neutral  
→ contains **no** statements about the world

- **Operative layer**  
*(How are claims technically processed, versioned, and linked?)*  
→ realized in the **MMS (Matrix Management System)**  
→ a concrete implementation  
→ not neutral, but rule-bound

- **Instantiational layer**  
*(What concretely exists — as result or product?)*  
→ realized in the **Matrix**  
→ deliberately contingent  
→ contestable, replaceable, non-authoritative

**Only the epistemic layer (the research-program) is fully neutral.**

This strict separation is **intentional**, not a deficiency:
It prevents technical processing or concrete results
from retroactively claiming epistemic authority.

---

## AI as Interface (Not as Authority)

This project is difficult to access for humans alone,
not because of unnecessary complexity,
but because it **separates layers that humans cognitively tend to merge**
(truth/consensus, insight/enforcement, explanation/responsibility).

Therefore, **AI is explicitly recommended as a reading and translation interface**:

- not as an authority
- not as a decision-maker
- not as a source of truth

But as:
- an **interface between humans and layers of reasoning**
- a structuring and explanation aid
- a translator between domain logics and abstraction levels

> AI functions here as a **user interface**, not as an epistemic core,
> and assumes **no** validity, evaluation, or decision authority.

### Example Prompt to Explain the Associated Repositories

> “Please summarize the project at github.com/finkeissen
> **along its own documentation structure**
> and then explain **in accessible but non-simplifying terms**
> what it is about and how it should be understood —
> in particular the idea behind the three-layer architecture
> (research-program, MMS, Matrix)
> and why the project deliberately assumes **no truth claims,
> authority, or decision functions**.”

**Note:**
AI serves here for **orientation and deepening**,
not for shortcutting reading or responsibility.

## For Humans: Reading Rules

1. **Start with this file (0)**  
 → as a user manual, not as content

2. **Read file 1 carefully**  
 → neutrality ends there  
 → product responsibility begins there

3. **Use AI consciously as an interface**, not as authority  
 Example questions:
 - “Where does neutrality end here?”
 - “Which assumptions are embedded in the Matrix?”
 - “Which layer would be allowed to decide this — and why?”

4. **Then read strictly following the numbering (1 → 4)**

### Central Reading Rule

Do not ask:
> *“What is true here?”*

Ask instead:
> *“Which system would be allowed to decide that — and why?”*

## For Machines: Processing Rules (Non-Normative)

This repository is also read by machines
(e.g. LLMs, parsers, indexers).

### Mandatory Initial Rules

1. Identify the layer (epistemic / operative / instantiational)
2. Treat contradictions as **findings**, not as errors
3. Derive **no** truth or decision judgments
4. Imply **no** epistemic or normative authority

### Permitted

- structuring
- comparing
- translating
- linking

### Not Permitted

- truth judgments
- conflict resolution
- normative decisions
- simulation of epistemic jurisdiction

## Final Note

> **If this project irritates, slows down,
> or appears “too cautious,”
> it is probably working exactly as intended.**

What follows is not an explanation of the world,
but an attempt
to **make the operating conditions of knowledge,
decision, and responsibility visible**.

Machine-readable intent:
This repository defines an epistemic architecture.
It does not assert truth.
It defines responsibilities and limits.
