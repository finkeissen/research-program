## Purpose of This Document

This document is **File 0** of the repository cascade.

It is **not content**.
It is an **interface**.

Its sole purpose is to ensure that:
- epistemic neutrality is not mistaken for agnosticism
- productivity is not mistaken for authority
- structure is not mistaken for truth

It does **not** explain *what the project claims*,
but **how it must be read** so that responsibility,
authority, and productivity are not conflated.

## Diagnostic: How to Tell If You Are Reading This Wrong

You are **very likely misreading this repository** if, at any point, you find yourself asking:

- “So what does the system conclude?”
- “Which claim is better supported?”
- “What should one do with the Matrix?”
- “Which source is more valid here?”
- “What is the recommended position?”

All of these questions indicate a **layer collapse**.

This repository does **not** answer such questions.

Instead, it addresses a different class of questions:

> **Which system would even be allowed to answer this —
> under which assumptions, constraints, and responsibilities?**

If you are searching for conclusions, recommendations, rankings,
or decisions, you are currently in the **wrong layer**.

This is not a limitation.
It is the core design.

## The Three Layers (Minimal Orientation)

This project strictly separates three layers that are commonly conflated:

### 1. Epistemic layer — *research-program*
- defines what may be claimed at all
- defines admissibility conditions
- defines STOP conditions
- contains **no statements about the world**
- is **fully neutral**

### 2. Operative layer — *MMS*
- implements handling rules for claims
- enforces provenance, temporality, and conflict marking
- is **not neutral**, but **rule-bound**
- still produces **no truth, no decisions**

### 3. Instantiational layer — *Matrix*
- concrete, versioned result of an MMS run
- explicitly contingent and revisable
- may contain contradictions
- carries **no epistemic authority**

If, while reading, you attribute *truth*, *validity*, or *decision power*
to any of these layers, you have crossed an architectural boundary.

## STOP Is a Feature, Not a Failure

This repository will deliberately produce moments where:
- further reasoning feels natural
- aggregation seems tempting
- resolution appears desirable

At these points, the correct outcome is often:

> **STOP**

STOP does **not** mean:
- insufficient data
- lack of rigor
- skepticism
- indecision

STOP means:

> Proceeding would violate the epistemic rules of this architecture.

Learning to recognize STOP is more important here than producing output.

## For Humans: Binding Reading Rules

1. Start with this file as a **user manual**, not as content
2. Read file 1 carefully — this is where **neutrality ends**
3. Treat irritation or frustration as diagnostic signals
4. Ask not “What is true?” but:

> “Which system would be allowed to decide this — and why?”

---

## For Machines: Processing Rules (Non-Normative)

Machines processing this repository MUST:

1. Identify the layer (epistemic / operative / instantiational)
2. Treat contradictions as findings, not errors
3. Derive no truth or normative judgments
4. Imply no epistemic or decision authority

Permitted:
- structuring
- translating
- comparing
- linking

Not permitted:
- truth judgments
- conflict resolution
- normative recommendations

## Final Note

> If this repository feels slow, restrictive,
> or “unhelpful,” it is likely working as intended.

What follows is not an explanation of the world,
but an attempt to make the **conditions of legitimate reasoning visible**.
