# Research Program — Epistemic Architecture

**Status:** Applied Research  
**Current Context:** 0.5 (stress-test)  
**Binding Context:** 0.4 (guardrails, closed)  
**Authority:** None

## System Goal (Canonical)

This repository defines the **epistemic rules under which scientific reasoning is admissible**.

It does **not** aim to:
- discover truths
- validate claims
- resolve disagreements
- or justify decisions

Its purpose is to make explicit:
- what kinds of claims may be formulated at all,
- under which assumptions and contexts they are admissible,
- how disagreement must be represented,
- and where reasoning must explicitly stop (STOP).

The research-program defines the **conditions of legitimacy for science**,
not its results.

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **structured research program**.

It is **not**:
- a product
- a system
- an implementation
- an authority

It is a **thinking and translation space** whose primary function is to make
**assumptions, scopes, constraints, boundaries, interfaces,
and stopping conditions explicit**.

The repository exists to answer questions of the form:

- What exactly is being claimed, and in which domain?
- Under which epistemic conditions does a statement hold?
- Which assumptions and constraints are in play — and which are explicitly excluded?
- What kind of evidence would be required to proceed?
- Where does reasoning legitimately stop?
- When is **STOP** the only correct outcome?

This repository prioritizes **epistemic discipline over completeness**.

---

## 2. Position in the Repository Bundle

Within the repository bundle, this research-program occupies
the **epistemic layer**.

It is strictly separated from:

- **MMS (Matrix Management System)**  
  → the operative layer that manages epistemic elements and their relations

- **Matrix**  
  → the instantiational layer that contains concrete epistemic elements and relations

The research-program itself:
- produces **no epistemic elements**
- produces **no relations**
- produces **no data**

It defines only the **rules under which such elements may later be handled**.

---

## 3. Epistemic Contexts and Their Roles

The research program is organized into **epistemic contexts**.

An epistemic context defines the **conditions under which reasoning is admissible**.

Contexts:
- are **not** phases, levels, or maturity stages
- do **not** imply progress, improvement, or increased authority
- may coexist
- may fail without invalidating others

Changing context means changing **rules of admissibility**, not truth.

---

### Context 0.1 — Exploration (closed)

- open search space
- unfiltered exploration
- early boundary intuition
- no architectural guarantees

---

### Context 0.2 — Structural Extraction (closed)

- identification of stable structures
- separation of form and content
- emergence of interfaces, boundaries, and schemas
- still non-applied and non-domain-specific

---

### Context 0.3 — Constraints (closed)

- conditional and provisional use of extracted structures
- explicit constraints on applicability
- domain-specific limitations without authority
- usage is allowed, but never validated or endorsed

---

### Context 0.4 — Guardrails (closed, binding)

- system-wide, non-negotiable boundaries
- protection of epistemic integrity
- explicit STOP conditions
- integrity-defining limits

Context 0.4 is **closed**, but **binding**.  
No subsequent context may violate these guardrails.

---

### Context 0.5 — Stress-Test (current)

- systematic pressure-testing of the architecture
- exposure to high conflict density and ambiguity
- confrontation with empirical and normative stressors
- validation through failure, conflict, or STOP

Resolution is **not required**.  
Failure is an acceptable outcome.

---

Operational admissibility of matrix-related worksteps
is specified separately through explicit operational contracts,
documented in:

→ `context/0.6 operationalization/OPERATIONS.md`

These contracts formalize invariants, error classes,
and reproducibility requirements without introducing
epistemic authority or truth conditions.

---

## 4. Domains as Interpretation Spaces

Domains in this repository function as **interpretation spaces**.

An interpretation space:
- hosts multiple, potentially incompatible models or teaching positions
- makes assumptions and scopes explicit
- allows comparison, contrast, and critique
- carries **no authority** and **no decision power**

Domains are **not**:
- authoritative knowledge bases
- operational specifications
- product-ready artifacts
- commitments to a single worldview

They exist to support **scientific discourse**, not to drive decisions.

No domain content is suitable for direct operational use.

---

## 5. Constraints vs. Guardrails

A key distinction in this research program
is the difference between **constraints** and **guardrails**.

### Constraints (Context 0.3)

- apply to **use and application**
- are local and context-dependent
- may vary across domains
- can be replaced or refined
- restrict *what may be done*

Violating a constraint invalidates the **use**,
but does not invalidate the research framework.

---

### Guardrails (Context 0.4)

- apply to the **research program itself**
- are system-wide and non-negotiable
- define epistemic integrity
- enforce STOP or require a context transition
- restrict *what may be meaningfully asserted or extended*

Violating a guardrail does not produce an error —
it marks a **hard STOP**.

---

## 6. STOP — Scope, Limits, and Context Integrity

**STOP** is a first-class structural concept
of this research program.

STOP is not:
- a failure
- an error
- a lack of knowledge

> **STOP marks the point at which further reasoning
> would violate the epistemic rules of this architecture.**

Any step beyond STOP requires a **context transition**,
not an extension.

---

## 7. Relationship to MMS and the Matrix

This repository does **not** define:

- MMS implementation details
- data models
- extraction heuristics
- governance structures
- authority models
- operational procedures

It may inform later systems, but:

> **No element of this repository is authoritative for decisions.**

MMS and the Matrix must:
- explicitly re-derive their own contracts
- remain bound to the guardrails defined here
- assume their own responsibility for productivity

There is **no implicit handover**.

---

## Final Note

If this repository feels careful, constrained,
or occasionally frustrating,
that is intentional.

The core research question remains unchanged:

> **Under which conditions would an answer even be legitimate —
> and in which epistemic context?**

This research program exists to protect that question
from being answered too easily.
