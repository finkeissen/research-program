## System Goal (Canonical)

This repository defines the **epistemic rules under which scientific reasoning is admissible**.

It does **not** aim to:
- discover truths
- validate claims
- resolve disagreements
- justify decisions
- rank evidence
- derive recommendations

Its purpose is to make explicit:
- what kinds of claims may be formulated at all,
- under which assumptions, contexts, and problem articulations they are admissible,
- how disagreement must be represented,
- which assumptions and constraints are mandatory, optional, or excluded,
- and where reasoning must explicitly stop (**STOP**).

The research-program defines the **conditions of epistemic legitimacy**,
not results, outcomes, utilities, or actions.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **structured research program**.

It is **not**:
- a product
- a system
- an implementation
- a framework for application
- an authority
- a decision aid

It is a **thinking and translation space** whose primary function is to make
**assumptions, scopes, constraints, boundaries, interfaces,
guardrails, stopping conditions, and problem contexts explicit**.

The repository exists to answer questions of the form:

- What exactly is being claimed, and in which domain and problem context?
- Under which epistemic conditions does a statement hold?
- Which assumptions and constraints are in play — and which are explicitly excluded?
- What kind of evidence would be required to proceed *within this context*?
- Where does reasoning legitimately stop?
- When is **STOP** the only admissible outcome?

This repository explicitly prioritizes **epistemic discipline**
over completeness, productivity, usefulness, or solution generation.

---

## 2. Position in the Repository Bundle

Within the repository bundle, this research-program occupies
the **epistemic layer**.

It is strictly separated from:

- **MMS (Matrix Management System)**  
  → the operative layer that manages epistemic elements and their relations

- **Matrix**  
  → the instantiational layer that contains concrete epistemic elements and relations

The research-program itself:
- produces **no epistemic elements**
- produces **no relations**
- produces **no data**
- produces **no outputs**
- maintains **no state**

It defines only the **rules under which such elements may later be handled**.

There is no implicit transition from this repository to productivity,
decision-making, or application.

## 2a. Epistemic Necessity (Physics Effect)

This research program rests on a minimal but binding epistemic necessity:

**Reality imposes constraints.  
Constraints force structure.  
Structure precedes interpretation.**

The *Physics Effect* does not introduce a theory, model, or worldview.
It names a structural condition of admissible reasoning:

- Claims cannot precede constraints.
- Interpretation cannot precede structure.- Structure cannot be replaced by narrative, preference, or intention.

From this necessity follows:

- the primacy of explicit problem articulation,
- the requirement to separate observation, assumption, and inference,
- the inadmissibility of solution-first reasoning,
- and the obligation to stop when constraints cannot be made explicit.

The Physics Effect is **not** an element of the system,
not a domain,
not a method,
and not an explanatory layer.

It is the **epistemic precondition** under which
any further structuring in this repository is admissible at all.


---

## 3. Problem-Centric Epistemic Orientation (Guardrail)

The research-program operates under the following binding orientation:

> **Problems are the primary crystallization points of epistemic work.**

Accordingly:
- Claims are admissible only if they arise from,
  or are explicitly assigned to,
  an articulated problem.
- There is no problem-free or neutral space
  in which claims may exist within this architecture.
- Claims detached from problem contexts
  are epistemically inadmissible.

This orientation does **not** assert that problems are:
- objective
- correct
- complete
- stable
- or shared

It only specifies that **without an explicit problem articulation,
epistemic processing must not proceed**.

This rule functions as a **guardrail**, not a heuristic or recommendation.

---

## 4. Epistemic Contexts and Their Roles

The research program is organized into **epistemic contexts**.

An epistemic context defines the **conditions under which reasoning is admissible**.
Changing context means changing **rules of admissibility**,
not truth, correctness, authority, or value.

Epistemic contexts:
- are **not** phases, levels, or maturity stages
- do **not** imply progress, improvement, or increased authority
- may coexist
- may fail independently
- may terminate in **STOP** without invalidating others

---

### Context 0.1 — Exploration (closed)

- open search space
- unfiltered exploration
- early boundary intuition
- provisional structures
- no architectural guarantees
- no binding constraints

This context allows failure, ambiguity, and redundancy
without producing commitments.

---

### Context 0.2 — Structural Extraction (closed)

- identification of stable structures
- separation of form and content
- emergence of interfaces, boundaries, and schemas
- abstraction without application
- still non-applied and non-domain-specific

Outputs from this context are **structural candidates**, not rules.

---

### Context 0.3 — Constraints (closed)

- conditional and provisional use of extracted structures
- explicit constraints on applicability
- domain-specific limitations without authority
- usage is allowed, but never validated or endorsed

Constraints restrict **use**, not epistemic legitimacy.

---

### Context 0.4 — Guardrails (closed, binding)

- system-wide, non-negotiable boundaries
- protection of epistemic integrity
- explicit STOP conditions
- integrity-defining limits
- prevention of category errors, layer collapse, and authority creep

Context 0.4 is **closed**, but **binding**.  
No subsequent context may violate these guardrails.

Any violation triggers **STOP**, not adaptation.

---

### Context 0.5 — Stress-Test (current)

- systematic pressure-testing of the architecture
- exposure to high conflict density and ambiguity
- confrontation with empirical and normative stressors
- validation through failure, contradiction, or STOP

Resolution is **not required**.  
Failure is an acceptable and expected outcome.

---

Operational admissibility of matrix-related worksteps
is specified separately through explicit operational contracts,
documented in:

→ `context/0.6 operationalization/OPERATIONS.md`

These contracts formalize invariants, error classes,
and reproducibility requirements **without introducing
epistemic authority, truth conditions, or decision logic**.

---

## 5. Domains as Interpretation Spaces

Domains in this repository function as **interpretation spaces**.

An interpretation space:
- hosts multiple, potentially incompatible models or positions
- makes assumptions and scopes explicit
- allows comparison, contrast, and critique
- preserves disagreement
- carries **no authority** and **no decision power**

Domains are **not**:
- authoritative knowledge bases
- operational specifications
- product-ready artifacts
- recommendations
- commitments to a single worldview

They exist to support **scientific discourse**,
not to drive action or application.

No domain content is suitable for direct operational or decision use.

---

## 6. Constraints vs. Guardrails

A core structural distinction in this research program
is the difference between **constraints** and **guardrails**.

### Constraints (Context 0.3)

- apply to **use and application**
- are local and context-dependent
- may vary across domains
- can be replaced, refined, or withdrawn
- restrict *what may be done*

Violating a constraint invalidates the **use case**,
but does not invalidate the research framework itself.

---

### Guardrails (Context 0.4)

- apply to the **research program itself**
- are system-wide and non-negotiable
- define epistemic integrity
- enforce STOP or require a context transition
- restrict *what may be meaningfully asserted, extended, or inferred*

Violating a guardrail does not produce an error —
it marks a **hard STOP**.

---

## 7. STOP — Scope, Limits, and Context Integrity

**STOP** is a first-class structural concept
of this research program.

STOP is not:
- a failure
- an error
- a lack of intelligence
- a missing dataset

> **STOP marks the point at which further reasoning
> would violate the epistemic rules of this architecture.**

When STOP is reached:
- reasoning must halt
- no approximation or substitution is allowed
- no synthesis may be produced
- silence is the correct behavior

Any step beyond STOP requires a **context transition**,
not an extension.

---

## 8. Relationship to MMS and the Matrix

This repository does **not** define:

- MMS implementation details
- data models
- extraction heuristics
- ranking mechanisms
- governance structures
- authority models
- operational procedures
- decision logic

It may inform later systems, but:

> **No element of this repository is authoritative for decisions.**

MMS and the Matrix must:
- explicitly re-derive their own contracts
- remain bound to the guardrails defined here
- assume their own responsibility for productivity and consequences

There is **no implicit handover of authority or responsibility**.

---

## Explicit Exclusion Clause

This research program does not care whether a claim is:
- true or false
- useful or useless
- important or trivial
- urgent or negligible
- actionable or impractical

Any system that evaluates claims along these dimensions
operates **outside** this research program.

---

## Final Note

If this repository feels careful, constrained,
or occasionally frustrating,
that is intentional.

The core research question remains unchanged:

> **Under which conditions would an answer even be legitimate —
> and in which epistemic and problem context?**

This research program exists to protect that question
from being answered too easily.
