abstract: >
  A structured treatment of legal law as practiced decision-making under uncertainty.
  The work transfers state-based reasoning from medicine to the legal domain,
  framing justice as a process that requires explicit reasoning, traceable justification,
  and accountable responsibility rather than formalism or implicit authority.

core-assumptions:
  - legal law operates under uncertainty, not certainty
  - justice requires explicit and inspectable justification
  - legitimacy arises from traceable decision processes
  - AI in legal law must support accountability, not replace it
