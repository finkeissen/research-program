title: Economics — Sincerity in the Macro-Organism World
type: book
role: coordination-context
status: stable

abstract: >
  A structural reframing of economics as coordination under uncertainty.
  The work focuses on incentives, scarcity, automation, and algorithmic coordination,
  treating economies as evolving macro-organisms that require explicit reasoning,
  traceable decisions, and responsibility rather than ideology or mere optimization.

core-assumptions:
  - economies are coordination problems, not merely markets
  - incentives shape behavior and responsibility
  - automation changes the meaning of scarcity and labor
  - optimization without accountability creates systemic risk
  - trust and sincerity are structural, not moral, variables
