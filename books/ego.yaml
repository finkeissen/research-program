status: stable

abstract: >
  An existential application of the research program at the level of the individual.
  The work explores identity, responsibility, and agency without relying on
  narrative psychology or biographical explanation, treating the ego as a
  structural phenomenon rather than a story or object.

core-assumptions:
  - the ego is not an object but a functional perspective
  - identity emerges from responsibility, not self-description
  - freedom requires structure, not arbitrariness
  - inner coherence is a prerequisite for outer cooperation
  - meaning arises from accountable action, not narrative

focus:
  - ego
  - identity
  - responsibility
  - agency
  - inner coherence
  - existential decision-making
