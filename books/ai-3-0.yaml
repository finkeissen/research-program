abstract: >
  A reframing of artificial intelligence through the lens of mature organizations.
  AI 3.0 is understood not as autonomous optimization, but as the embedding of
  explicit knowledge, decision structures, and responsibility into organizations
  that act as long-term carriers of reasoning and accountability.

core-assumptions:
  - organizations are the primary carriers of applied intelligence
  - intelligence without responsibility creates systemic risk
  - AI must be embedded in explicit decision structures
  - maturity is a prerequisite for delegating decisions to machines
  - automation amplifies structure, not intent

focus:
  - organizational intelligence
  - decision structures
  - automation
  - responsibility
  - accountability
  - long-term knowledge carriers
