type: book
role: collective-coordination-context
status: stable

abstract: >
  A reframing of politics as the coordination of mature actors under conditions
  of power, conflict, and uncertainty.
  Rather than moral performance or ideological positioning, the work emphasizes
  humility, responsibility, and structural capacity as prerequisites for legitimate
  political decision-making.

core-assumptions:
  - political decisions are coordination problems under power asymmetries
  - legitimacy depends on responsibility, not moral signaling
  - maturity is a prerequisite for sustainable political action
  - humility is a structural requirement, not a personal virtue
  - politics fails when responsibility is externalized
