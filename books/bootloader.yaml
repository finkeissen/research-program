abstract: >
  An initialization layer for human and machine reasoning.
  It defines the minimal grammar required to enter complex domains
  without premature meaning, narrative shortcuts, or solution bias.

core-assumptions:
  - complex problems require an explicit initialization phase
  - premature meaning produces hidden constraints and false certainty
  - reasoning must start from inspectable primitives and states

focus:
  - initialization
  - primitives
  - state
  - assumptions
  - traceability
  - responsibility
