# Book Manifests

This directory contains machine-readable manifests for the books
that form the Finkeissen Research Program.

These files are **not** the books.
They are **structural skeletons**: stable identifiers, roles, relations, and pointers.

Each manifest specifies:
- the role of a book within the program
- its conceptual focus
- its relations to other books
- references to external artifacts (print, notes, repositories)

The manifests are **not** representations of the book contents.
They provide structural orientation and explicit relations,
not summaries or tables of contents.

## Start here

If you want a concrete entry point, open one manifest directly:

- `physics-effect.yaml` — epistemic admissibility via measurable interaction (the “Physics Effect” stance)

From there, follow the relation links inside the manifest to traverse the program.

## How to use these manifests

Use this directory to:
- navigate across domains without relying on implicit authority
- track which book claims what role in the overall program
- inspect cross-book dependencies and boundary relations
- reference the program’s long-form structure from code, notes, or discussion

Books themselves remain independent artifacts.
This directory serves as a stable, inspectable reference layer
for humans and machines alike.
