# Book Manifests

This directory contains machine-readable manifests for the books
that form the Finkeissen Research Program.

Each file describes:
- the role of a book within the program
- its conceptual focus
- its relations to other books
- references to external artifacts (print, notes, repositories)

The manifests are **not** representations of the book contents.
They provide structural orientation and explicit relations,
not summaries or tables of contents.

Books themselves remain independent artifacts.
This directory serves as a stable, inspectable reference layer
for humans and machines alike.
