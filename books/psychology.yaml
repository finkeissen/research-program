abstract: >
  A structural reframing of psychology focused on maturity as a functional capacity.
  Rather than biographical narratives or trait-based models, the work emphasizes
  inner structure, state awareness, and the ability to hold responsibility in
  complex decision-making.

core-assumptions:
  - maturity is a structural capacity, not a personality trait
  - psychological failure often results from missing inner structure
  - responsibility requires inner differentiation and stability
  - inner states are functionally relevant and inspectable
