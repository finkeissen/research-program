# AUDIT WALKTHROUGH
## External Stress Test of the Architecture

---

## Status

This document simulates an **external audit perspective**.

It does not extend the architecture,
introduce new rules,
or propose improvements.

It checks only whether
the existing structure
behaves as claimed under pressure.

---

## Audit Premise

The auditor assumes:

- no trust in intent,
- no sympathy for goals,
- no allowance for pedagogy,
- no benefit of the doubt.

Only structural consistency is evaluated.

---

## Audit Step 1 — Research Program Authority

### Check

Does the Research Program define
structural existence conditions
rather than merely aspirations?

### Observation

- RP defines admissible entity types.
- RP defines interfaces and prohibitions.
- RP contains explicit minimality constraints (Occam).
- RP isolates its own normative starting point (Münchhausen).

### Result

PASS.

RP functions as a structural core,
not a requirement list.

---

## Audit Step 2 — MMS Power Containment

### Check

Can MMS introduce structure,
authority,
or interpretation implicitly?

### Observation

- MMS authority is explicitly denied.
- MMS enforces binary admissibility only.
- MMS cannot repair, normalize, or infer.
- MMS treats SELF-APPLICATION as inert.

### Result

PASS.

MMS is a pure enforcement layer.

---

## Audit Step 3 — Matrix Autonomy

### Check

Does the Matrix acquire
interpretive or structural power
through accumulation?

### Observation

- Matrix defines no entities.
- Matrix resolves no conflicts.
- Matrix ranks nothing.
- Matrix records STOP and Absence explicitly.

### Result

PASS.

Matrix remains passive and non-authoritative.

---

## Audit Step 4 — STOP Integrity

### Check

Can STOP be bypassed,
softened,
or compensated for?

### Observation

- STOP is terminal.
- STOP produces no substitute output.
- STOP propagates unchanged.
- STOP is auditable and referencable.

### Result

PASS.

STOP functions as a hard boundary.

---

## Audit Step 5 — Minimality Claim (Occam)

### Check

Is unnecessary structure present?

### Observation

- Every structural element blocks
  an explicit failure mode.
- No element is decorative.
- No optimization logic is present.
- No explanatory surplus is embedded.

### Result

PASS (provisionally).

Minimality holds relative
to identified collapse modes.

---

## Audit Step 6 — Book Integration (Physics Effect / Denkebenen)

### Check

Do referenced books function
as authorities or sources of legitimacy?

### Observation

- Origins are declared but isolated.
- No rule derives authority from books.
- Books are treated as external material.
- Anti-theoretical elements survive;
  explanatory elements trigger STOP.

### Result

PASS.

No authority leakage detected.

---

## Audit Step 7 — Self-Reference Risk

### Check

Does the system smuggle
self-legitimation or closure?

### Observation

- Münchhausen move is explicit.
- It is declared inadmissible.
- It is isolated and non-repeatable.
- No internal evaluation exists.

### Result

PASS.

Self-reference is visible but contained.

---

## Audit Step 8 — Failure Mode Identification

### Check

How does the system fail?

### Observation

The system can fail only by:

- refusing too much,
- remaining silent,
- becoming unusable,
- being rejected externally.

It cannot fail by
producing false authority internally.

### Result

PASS.

Failure modes are epistemically safe.

---

## Final Audit Conclusion

From a structural audit perspective:

- No hidden authority detected.
- No implicit normativity detected.
- No layer collapse detected.
- No unbounded complexity detected.

The architecture is **harsh but consistent**.

---

## Audit Disclaimer

This audit does not claim:

- usefulness,
- adoption viability,
- completeness,
- correctness,
- desirability.

It claims only:

> The system behaves
> according to its own rules.
