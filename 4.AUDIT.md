## Purpose of This Document

This document describes the **externally auditable surface**
of the repository bundle.

It answers exactly one question:

> **How can one verify that this system
> adheres to its own stated rules?**

Audit here means:
- traceability
- reproducibility
- rule compliance
- transparency of limits

Auditability does **not** imply
unrestricted, complete, or automated access
to all data or artifacts.

---

## 1. Audit Goals (Binding)

An audit serves to demonstrate that:

- no implicit truth decisions are made
- epistemic, operative, and instantiational layers are strictly separated
- artifacts are versioned and referencable
- provenance is explicitly documented
- known limitations are openly declared

An audit does **not** serve:
- content evaluation
- conflict resolution
- normative assessment
- authority validation

---

## 2. Current Audit Status (as of January 2026)

| Area                     | Status              | Evidence / Location                     | Last Review |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Epistemic kernel         | stable, frozen      | research-program + TRANSPARENCY.md       | Jan 2026    |
| MMS specification        | defined             | MMS repository + contracts               | Jan 2026    |
| Medical domain           | ~70% coverage       | Domain reports + issues                  | Dec 2025    |
| German law domain        | ~70% coverage       | Domain reports + issues                  | Dec 2025    |

| Provenance tracking      | implemented         | MMS status fields                        | ongoing     |
| Conflict tracking        | implemented         | MMS conflict markers                     | ongoing     |

### Meaning of “~70% Coverage”

A domain is considered “~70% covered” if:

- approximately 70% of central concepts or norms are extracted
- ≥ 60% of major conflicts are explicitly marked
- ≥ 80% of statements have explicit provenance

This is **not** a completeness or quality guarantee.

---

## 3. Known Limitations & Risks

The following points are **known and audit-relevant**:

- unavoidable LLM hallucinations  
  → mitigated through mandatory provenance

- high conflict density in certain domains  
  → especially law (historical vs. current norms)

- Matrix scalability limits  
  → performance degradation expected with many domains

- dependence on model quality  
  → model changes alter Matrix contents

- no guarantee of completeness or timeliness

These are **structural characteristics**,
not implementation bugs.

---

## 4. How to Perform an Independent Audit

An audit can begin without privileged access:

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**  
   → verify layer separation, guardrails, STOP rules

2. **README research-program+mms+matrix.md**  
   → verify correct responsibility boundaries

3. **TRANSPARENCY.md**  
   → verify that disclosure limits are reasoned

4. **Domain sampling**  
   → inspect versioning, provenance, conflict markers

5. **Issue tracker**  
   → labels: `audit`, `provenance`, `conflict`, `limitation`

---

## 5. External Audits

External audits are **explicitly welcome**.

Procedure:
- open an issue labeled `audit`
- specify scope (domain, structure, reproducibility, etc.)

For sensitive components:
- selective access may be granted
- NDA-based review is possible

---

## 6. Scope Delimitation

This audit system is **not**:

- a certification authority
- a truth arbiter
- a governance institution
- a quality seal
- a content validation mechanism

It audits **structural integrity**, not correctness.

---

## Final Note

> This document makes the project **auditable**
> without making it **authoritative**.

Audit here is not an instrument of power,
but a **protective layer against implicit epistemic claims**.
