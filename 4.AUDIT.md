## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **externally auditable surface**
of the repository bundle.

It answers exactly one question:

> **How can one verify that this system
> adheres to its own explicitly stated rules?**

Audit here means:
- traceability of artifacts,
- reproducibility of processing steps,
- explicit rule compliance,
- visibility of limits, STOPs, and failures,
- accountability of non-disclosure.

Auditability does **not** imply
unrestricted, complete, automated,
or real-time access to all components.

---

## 1. Audit Goals (Binding)

An audit serves to demonstrate that:

- no implicit truth decisions are made,
- epistemic, operative, and instantiational layers remain strictly separated,
- admissibility rules from the research-program are respected,
- problem-centric constraints are enforced or explicitly violated and flagged,
- artifacts are versioned, referencable, and historically bound,
- provenance is explicitly documented,
- conflicts are preserved rather than resolved,
- known limitations are openly declared.

An audit does **not** serve:
- content evaluation,
- correctness assessment,
- conflict resolution,
- normative ranking,
- authority validation.

## 2. Current Audit Status (as of January 2026)

The following status indicators are **descriptive**, not evaluative.

| Area                     | Status              | Evidence / Location                       | Last Review |
|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Epistemic kernel         | stable, frozen      | research-program + ARCHITECTURE.md         | Jan 2026    |
| MMS specification        | defined             | MMS repository + contracts                 | Jan 2026    |
| Medical domain           | ~70% extracted      | Domain reports + issues                    | Dec 2025    |

| Autohealing domain       | ~70% extracted      | Domain reports + issues                    | Dec 2025    |
| Provenance tracking      | implemented         | MMS record fields                          | ongoing     |
| Conflict tracking        | implemented         | MMS conflict markers                       | ongoing     |

### Meaning of “~70% Extracted”

“~70% extracted” indicates that:

- approximately 70% of central concepts or norms
  have been explicitly articulated,
- ≥ 60% of major known conflicts are marked,
- ≥ 80% of statements have explicit provenance,
- all artifacts remain explicitly contingent.

This metric does **not** indicate:
- completeness,
- correctness,
- stability,
- representativeness,
- or readiness for application.

---

## 3. Known Limitations & Risks

The following characteristics are **structural and audit-relevant**:

- unavoidable LLM hallucinations  
  → mitigated through mandatory provenance and conflict marking

- high conflict density in certain domains  
  → especially law (historical vs. current norms)

- Matrix scalability limits  
  → performance degradation expected with many domains

- dependence on model quality and configuration  
  → model changes alter Matrix contents

- non-deterministic extraction behavior

- no guarantee of completeness, timeliness, or cross-problem coherence

These are **acknowledged properties**,
not implementation defects.

## 4. How to Perform an Independent Audit

An audit can begin **without privileged access**.

Recommended procedure:

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md**  
   → verify layer separation, guardrails, STOP logic,
     and problem-centric admissibility.

2. **README research-program+mms+matrix.md**  
   → verify correct responsibility boundaries
     and absence of implicit authority transfer.

3. **TRANSPARENCY.md**  
   → verify that disclosure limits are explicit,
     reasoned, and contestable.

4. **Matrix sampling**  
   → inspect versioning, provenance,
     conflict markers, and problem references.

5. **Issue tracker**  
   → labels: `audit`, `provenance`, `conflict`,
     `problem`, `limitation`, `stop`.

Audit findings are expected to include:
- disagreements,
- contradictions,
- uncovered violations,
- or explicit STOP confirmations.

---

## 5. External Audits

External audits are **explicitly welcomed**.

Procedure:
- open an issue labeled `audit`,
- specify scope (architecture, MMS behavior, domain handling, reproducibility).

For sensitive components:
- selective access may be granted,
- NDA-based review is possible,
- redacted artifacts may be used.

External audits do **not** gain authority
over the system or its contents.

---

## 6. Scope Delimitation

This audit framework is **not**:

- a certification authority,
- a truth arbiter,
- a governance institution,
- a quality seal,
- a compliance guarantee,
- a content validation mechanism.

It audits **structural integrity and rule adherence**,
not epistemic correctness.

---

## Detection of Abyss-Crossing

Audits within this repository bundle do not assess correctness,
truth, or quality of outcomes.

They assess **epistemic admissibility**.

An audit MUST flag a violation if any output exists where
an epistemic abyss should have resulted in STOP.

Indicators of abyss-crossing include, but are not limited to:

- the presence of synthesized conclusions
  where incompatible problem articulations remain unresolved,
- the appearance of balanced or averaged positions
  without an explicit authority-bearing decision,
- implicit assignment of responsibility
  where responsibility could not be derived without presupposition,
- aggregation of claims that masks irreducible conflict,
- representation of interpretation as structural necessity,
- outputs that imply inevitability or optimality
  without explicitly declared exclusions.

An audit finding does not imply error or misconduct.

It indicates that **an epistemic boundary may have been crossed**
and that the output exceeds the admissible scope
defined by the research-program.

Remediation is not defined here.

Any continuation requires
explicit reassignment of responsibility
outside the epistemic layer.


---

## Final Note

> This document makes the project **auditable**
> without making it **authoritative**.

Audit here is not an instrument of control or legitimacy,
but a **protective layer against implicit epistemic claims**.

Any audit that attempts to derive authority,
truth, or correctness from compliance
operates outside this architecture.
