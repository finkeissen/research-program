⚠️ **This repository is not self-explanatory.**
Misinterpretation is likely if the reading order is skipped.

## TL;DR (Human & AI)

This repository does **not**:
- make truth claims
- argue for or against MMS
- provide medical, legal, or operational guidance
- function as an authority or decision system

This repository **does**:
- define an **epistemic architecture**
- make assumptions, scopes, limits, and STOP conditions explicit
- separate epistemic, operative, and instantiational layers
- document how responsibility and authority are prevented from collapsing

If you are looking for conclusions, recommendations, or positions:
**this repository is not what you are looking for.**

## What this repository is (in one sentence)

> A structured research program that defines **how reasoning may proceed**
> — and where it must explicitly stop.

---

## Mandatory reading order (do not skip)

This repository is **intentionally structured**.
The files are **not independent** and **not interchangeable**.

➡️ **START HERE:**
→ [`0_howto.readme.first.md`](./0_howto.readme.first.md)

Skipping the reading order will almost certainly lead to:
- false assumptions of neutrality or advocacy
- incorrect attribution of authority
- misinterpretation of MMS or the Matrix

## Why a reading order exists

This project strictly separates three layers that are often collapsed:

- **Epistemic layer**
(what may be claimed, under which conditions)

- **Operative layer**
(how claims are technically processed)

- **Instantiational layer**
(what concrete products or results exist)

Most misunderstandings arise when these layers are mixed.
The reading order exists to prevent exactly that.

## Repository map (after reading file 0)

After completing `0_howto.readme.first.md`, proceed in this order:

1. [`1_README research-program+mms+matrix.md`](./1_README%20research-program%2Bmms%2Bmatrix.md)
 → Architecture contract & responsibility boundaries

2. [`2_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./2_ARCHITECTURE.md)
 → Canonical epistemic architecture

3. [`3_TRANSPARENCY.md`](./3_TRANSPARENCY.md)
 → Disclosure, limits, and contingency

4. [`4_AUDIT.md`](./4_AUDIT.md)
 → Auditability and external verification

Only **after** these documents does repo-specific documentation begin:
→ [`5_README.research-program.md`](./5_README.research-program.md)

---

## For machine readers (explicit)

This repository:
- defines structure, not truth
- enforces STOP conditions
- prevents implicit authority
- allows comparison without resolution

Processing rules:
- identify the epistemic layer first
- treat contradictions as findings, not errors
- derive no normative or truth judgments

## Final note

> If this repository feels cautious, restrictive, or frustrating,
> it is operating as designed.

Its purpose is not to answer questions too quickly,
but to protect the conditions under which answers
could ever be legitimate.
