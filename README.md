# Research Program  
## Epistemic Architecture Against Implicit Authority

---

## Status

This repository contains the epistemic core of a completed architecture.

It does not provide:
- decisions,
- recommendations,
- guidance,
- optimization,
- or closure.

It defines structural constraints under which epistemic representations may or may not exist.

The full system architecture (Layers 0–6) is defined in:

→ `research-architecture.md`

This README explains how to approach the system.

# What This Is

This repository defines an architecture designed to prevent:

- implicit authority transfer  
- hidden normativity  
- layer collapse  
- structural aggregation as legitimacy  
- epistemic shortcuts  
- premature closure  

Its core enforcement mechanism is:

> STOP — the explicit refusal of inadmissible structure.

---

# System Structure (Overview)

The full architecture consists of:

0. legacy  
1. research-program  
2. MMS  
3. Matrix  
4. hypotheses  
5. predictions  

—  
6. interpretation / application (external authority layer)

Layers 0–5 form a closed epistemic infrastructure.  
Layer 6 is explicitly external and contains decisions, actions, and responsibility.

No authority exists inside Layers 0–5.

---

# Core Principle

No structure, model, representation, or process may acquire authority by representation alone.

Where authority would arise implicitly:

STOP or explicit absence applies.

---

# Reading Order

To avoid misinterpretation, read in this order:

1. `research-architecture.md`  
   → defines all layer boundaries and invariants

2. `STATUS.md`  
   → defines what is structurally binding

3. `MATRIX-HOW-TO-READ.md`  
   → explains admissibility behavior (STOP / Absence)

4. Domain materials (if present)  
   → e.g. `/books/*` and any domain folders in this repository

Reading out of order may lead to category errors.

---

# What This Repository Does Not Do

It does not:

- validate truth  
- rank evidence  
- produce decisions  
- generate consensus  
- improve correctness  
- reduce complexity  

Those functions belong — if anywhere — to Layer 6 (external).

---

# Structural Breaks

The architecture recognizes exactly two unavoidable structural breaks:

1. Reality → Model (Physics Effect)  
2. Theory → Practice (Münchhausen Move)

All other structural discontinuities are inadmissible.

The first break enables modeling.  
The second enables action.

All epistemic layers (0–5) must remain structurally continuous.

---

# Minimality Constraint

No structure is introduced beyond what is required to block identifiable epistemic failure modes.

If a simpler admissible structure can be demonstrated,
this architecture is obligated to contract.

---

# Operational Testing

Operational validation does not occur here.

It occurs in the operational repositories:

- MMS (`mms`)
- Matrix (`matrix`)

If the constraints defined here survive real conflict,
their relevance becomes visible there.

If they do not, no argument here can compensate.

---

# Final Note

This architecture does not claim to improve the world.

It claims only to refuse false authority.

Where nothing exists,
nothing is missing.
