# Research Program  
## Epistemic Architecture Against Implicit Authority

---

## Status

This repository contains the epistemic core of a structurally defined architecture.

It does not provide:
- decisions,
- recommendations,
- guidance,
- optimization,
- or closure.

It defines structural constraints under which epistemic representations may or may not exist.

The full system architecture (Layers 0–6) is defined in:

→ `research-architecture.md`

This README explains how to approach the system.

# What This Is

This repository defines an architecture designed to prevent:

- implicit authority transfer  
- hidden normativity  
- layer collapse  
- structural aggregation as legitimacy  
- epistemic shortcuts  
- premature closure  

Its core enforcement mechanism is:

> STOP — the explicit refusal of inadmissible structure.

It is an architecture of refusal:
refusal to allow structure to silently become authority.

---

# System Structure (Overview)

The full architecture consists of:

0. legacy  
1. research-program  
2. MMS  
3. Matrix  
4. hypotheses  
5. predictions  

—  
6. interpretation / application (external authority layer)

Layers 0–5 form a closed epistemic infrastructure.

Layer 6 is explicitly external and contains:
- decisions,
- actions,
- prioritization,
- tradeoff resolution,
- and responsibility.

No authority exists inside Layers 0–5.

Authority exists only in Layer 6.

---

# Core Principle

No structure, model, representation, or process may acquire authority by representation alone.

Where authority would arise implicitly:

STOP or explicit absence applies.

STOP does not indicate failure.  
STOP indicates boundary enforcement.

---

# Reading Order

To avoid misinterpretation, read in this order:

1. `research-architecture.md`  
   → defines all layer boundaries, invariants, and failure modes

2. `STATUS.md`  
   → defines what is structurally binding and what is not

3. `MATRIX-HOW-TO-READ.md`  
   → explains admissibility behavior (STOP / Absence)

4. Domain materials  
   → `/books/*` and domain folders in this repository

Reading out of order may lead to category errors.

---

# What This Repository Does Not Do

It does not:

- validate truth  
- rank evidence  
- produce decisions  
- generate consensus  
- improve correctness  
- reduce complexity  

Those functions belong — if anywhere — to Layer 6 (external).

---

# Structural Breaks

The architecture recognizes exactly two unavoidable structural breaks:

1. Reality → Model (Physics Effect)  
2. Theory → Practice (Münchhausen Move)

All other structural discontinuities are inadmissible.

The first break enables modeling.  
The second enables action.

All epistemic layers (0–5) must remain structurally continuous.

The Münchhausen Move corresponds structurally to Layer 6,
where responsibility and decision occur outside the epistemic infrastructure.

---

# Minimality Constraint

No structure is introduced beyond what is required to block identifiable epistemic failure modes.

Minimality is asserted relative to collapse risks,
not relative to usefulness or explanatory power.

If a simpler admissible structure can be demonstrated,
this architecture is obligated to contract.

---

# Operational Testing

Operational validation does not occur here.

It occurs in the operational repositories:

- MMS (`mms`)
- Matrix (`matrix`)

If the constraints defined here survive real conflict,
their relevance becomes visible there.

If they do not, no argument here can compensate.

---

## Role in the architecture

The research-program defines the epistemic conditions under which artifacts may exist.

It does not create artifacts.
It defines admissibility.

When admissibility cannot be established:
- MMS enforces STOP,
- artifacts regress to Legacy,
- or remain absent from the Matrix.


## STOP across layers

Within this repository, STOP defines inadmissible reasoning.

Across the architecture:
- MMS enforces STOP,
- Matrix records STOP,
- Legacy preserves unresolved structures.

## External orientation

This repository rarely produces visible outputs.
Its effects appear indirectly in MMS behavior,
Matrix structure,
and the presence of STOP.

---

# Final Note

This architecture does not claim to improve the world.

It claims only to refuse false authority.

Where nothing exists,
nothing is missing.
