# Research Program

**Status:** Applied Research  
**Version:** 0.4  
**Maturity:** Structurally complete, non-authoritative  
**Authority:** None

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **structured research program**.

It is not a product, not a system, and not an authority.  
It is a **thinking and translation space** whose primary purpose is to make
**assumptions, scopes, constraints, boundaries, interfaces, and stopping conditions explicit**.

The repository exists to answer questions of the form:

- What exactly is being claimed, and in which domain?
- Under which scope does a statement hold?
- Which assumptions and constraints are in play — and which are explicitly excluded?
- What kind of evidence would be required to proceed?
- Where does reasoning legitimately stop?
- When is STOP the only correct outcome?

This repository prioritizes **epistemic discipline over completeness**.

---

## 2. Research Phases and Their Roles

The research program is organized into **epistemic phases**.
These are not software versions, but **distinct modes of inquiry**.

### Phase 0.1 — Explorations
- open search space
- unfiltered exploration
- early boundary intuition
- no architectural guarantees

### Phase 0.2 — Structural Extraction
- identification of stable structures
- separation of form and content
- emergence of interfaces, boundaries, and schemas
- still non-applied and non-domain-specific

### Phase 0.3 — Constraints
- **conditional and provisional use** of extracted structure
- explicit constraints on applicability
- domain-specific limitations without authority
- usage is allowed, but never validated or endorsed

### Phase 0.4 — Guardrails
- system-wide, non-negotiable boundaries
- protection of epistemic integrity
- explicit STOP conditions
- version-defining limits

Each phase is complete **in its own terms**.
No phase retroactively validates or corrects earlier phases.

## 3. What Version 0.4 Represents

Version **0.4** represents a **structurally complete research architecture**.

It consolidates all prior phases into a coherent framework that is:

- internally consistent
- explicitly bounded
- domain-capable
- non-authoritative by design

Version 0.4 completes the **epistemic and architectural groundwork** of the research program.

It deliberately does **not** introduce:
- external empirical constraints
- ontological commitments
- world models
- unifying explanations
- authoritative decision logic

All such extensions are intentionally deferred.

---

## 4. Domains as Interpretation Spaces

Domains in this repository function as **interpretation spaces**.

An interpretation space:
- hosts **multiple, potentially incompatible models or teaching positions**
- makes assumptions and scopes explicit
- allows comparison, contrast, and critique
- carries **no authority** and **no decision power**

Domains are **not**:
- authoritative knowledge bases
- operational specifications
- product-ready artifacts
- commitments to a single worldview

They exist to support **research discourse**, not to drive decisions.

No domain content is suitable for direct operational use.

---

## 5. What This Repository Is

This repository **is**:

- a structured research and translation environment
- a framework for making assumptions, scopes, and constraints explicit
- a space for hosting interpretation spaces without collapsing them into a shared ontology
- a preparation layer for later systems that must still re-derive their own contracts

The repository supports exploration and constrained use **without implicit authority**.

---

## 6. What This Repository Is Not

This repository **is not**:

- a reference architecture
- a domain ontology
- an expert system
- a decision-making authority
- a policy, legal, or ethics engine
- suitable for production, automation, or delegation
- a world model
- stable or backward-compatible

No content here should be used directly for:
- implementation
- optimization
- automation
- real-world decision-making

---

## 7. Constraints vs. Guardrails

A key distinction in this research program is the difference between
**constraints** and **guardrails**.

### Constraints (Phase 0.3)
- apply to **use and application**
- are local and context-dependent
- may vary across domains
- can be replaced or refined
- restrict *what may be done*

Violating a constraint invalidates the **use**,  
but does not invalidate the research framework.

---

### Guardrails (Phase 0.4)
- apply to the **research program itself**
- are system-wide and non-negotiable
- define version integrity
- enforce STOP or require a version transition
- restrict *what may be meaningfully asserted or extended*

Violating a guardrail does not produce an error —  
it marks a **hard STOP**.

---

## 8. STOP — Scope, Limits, and Version Integrity

**STOP** is a first-class structural concept of this research program.

STOP is not a failure, an error, or a lack of knowledge.

> **STOP is an explicit boundary at which this research program cannot proceed
> without violating its own epistemic rules.**

STOP functions as a **guardrail**.

Any step beyond these limits requires a **version transition**, not an extension.

---

## 9. Relationship to MMS and Governance Work

This repository does **not** define:

- MMS
- governance structures
- authority models
- responsibility assignments
- operational procedures

It may inform later systems, but:

> No element of this repository is authoritative for decisions.

Any operational or governance system must
explicitly re-derive its own contracts, assumptions, and responsibilities.

There is no implicit handover.

---

## 10. Versioning Philosophy

- 0.1 — explorations (closed)
- 0.2 — structural extraction (closed)
- 0.3 — constraints (closed)
- 0.4 — guardrails (current)
- ≥ 0.5 — externally constrained
- ≥ 1.0 — authoritative (outside this repository)

---

## 11. Final Note

If this repository feels careful, constrained, and explicit, that is intentional.

The core research question remains unchanged:

> “Under which conditions would an answer even be legitimate —
> and in which domain?”

Version **0.4** completes the structural groundwork required
to ask that question rigorously —  
and to stop when stopping is the only honest option.
