# Repository Entry Point

⚠️ **This repository follows a mandatory reading order.**

This `README.md` is **not** the starting point.

Please begin with:

→ **`0 HOWTO.README.md`**

Only after reading files `0–4` does the repo-specific documentation begin
(`5 README.research-program.md`).

Skipping the reading order will almost certainly lead to
misinterpretation of scope, authority, or intent.
