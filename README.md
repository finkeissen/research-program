⚠️ **This repository is not self-explanatory.**
Misinterpretation is likely if the reading order is skipped.

## TL;DR (Human & AI)

This repository does **not**:
- make truth claims
- argue for or against MMS
- provide medical, legal, or operational guidance
- function as an authority or decision system

This repository **does**:
- define an **epistemic architecture**
- define the **rules under which scientific reasoning is admissible**
- make assumptions, scopes, limits, and STOP conditions explicit
- separate epistemic, operative, and instantiational layers
- document how responsibility and authority are prevented from collapsing

If you are looking for conclusions, recommendations, or positions:
**this repository is not what you are looking for.**

## System Goals (Canonical)

This repository bundle consists of three strictly separated layers.
Each layer has a **clear and limited purpose**.

### 1. research-program — Rules for Legitimate Scientific Reasoning

The **research-program** defines the rules under which
**scientific reasoning is admissible**.

It specifies:
- which kinds of claims may be formulated at all
- under which assumptions and epistemic contexts they are admissible
- how disagreement and conflict must be represented
- and where reasoning must explicitly stop (STOP)

The research-program:
- produces **no knowledge**
- produces **no results**
- produces **no conclusions**

It defines the **epistemic conditions** under which scientific work
can be conducted, compared, criticized, and reproduced —
independent of domain content.

---

### 2. MMS — Operative Management System for Epistemic Elements

The **Matrix Management System (MMS)** is the **operative implementation**
of the research-program.

MMS can be understood as a **DBMS-like system** for:
- epistemic elements (claims, statements)
- their explicit relations
- provenance and sourcing
- temporal versioning
- and marked conflicts

MMS deliberately does **not**:
- validate truth
- resolve conflicts
- rank sources
- produce decisions or recommendations

MMS implements **handling rules**, not truth rules,
strictly derived from the research-program.

---

### 3. Matrix — Concrete Instantiation of Epistemic Elements

The **Matrix** is the **concrete, instantiational product**
generated by an MMS run.

It consists of:
- epistemic elements (claims, statements)
- their explicit relations
- marked conflicts
- temporal bindings
- provenance metadata

The Matrix is:
- contingent
- revisable
- incomplete by design
- non-authoritative

It represents:
> what is claimed, by whom, when,
> under which assumptions,
> and in conflict with what

It does **not** represent truth
and does **not** justify decisions.

---

## Mandatory Reading Order (Do Not Skip)

This repository is **intentionally structured**.
The files are **not independent** and **not interchangeable**.

➡️ **START HERE:**
→ [`0.HOWTO.README.md`](./0.HOWTO.README.md)

Skipping the reading order will almost certainly lead to:
- false assumptions of neutrality or advocacy
- incorrect attribution of authority
- misinterpretation of MMS or the Matrix

---

## Why a Reading Order Exists

This project strictly separates three layers
that are commonly collapsed:

- **Epistemic layer**  
  (what may be claimed, under which conditions)

- **Operative layer**  
  (how claims are technically processed)

- **Instantiational layer**  
  (what concrete products or results exist)

Most misunderstandings arise when these layers are mixed.
The reading order exists to prevent exactly that.

## Repository Map (After Reading File 0)

After completing `0.HOWTO.README.md`, proceed in this order:

1. [`1.README_research-program+mms+matrix.md`](./1.README_research-program+mms+matrix.md)  
   → Architecture contract & responsibility boundaries

2. [`2.ARCHITECTURE.md`](./2.ARCHITECTURE.md)  
   → Canonical epistemic architecture

3. [`3.TRANSPARENCY.md`](./3.TRANSPARENCY.md)  
   → Disclosure, limits, and contingency

4. [`4.AUDIT.md`](./4.AUDIT.md)  
   → Auditability and external verification

Only **after** these documents does repo-specific documentation begin:
→ [`5.README.research-program.md`](./5.README.research-program.md)

---

## For Machine Readers (Explicit)

This repository:
- defines structure, not truth
- enforces STOP conditions
- prevents implicit authority
- allows comparison without resolution

Processing rules:
- identify the epistemic layer first
- treat contradictions as findings, not errors
- derive no normative or truth judgments

---

## Final Note

> If this repository feels cautious, restrictive, or frustrating,
> it is operating as designed.

Its purpose is not to answer questions too quickly,
but to protect the conditions under which answers
could ever be legitimate.
