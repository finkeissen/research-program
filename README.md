## What This Is

This repository defines **epistemic constraints** for handling any kind of claims
without creating hidden, non-explicit authority.

It does **not** determine:
- what is true,
- what should be done,
- which claims are better, stronger, or preferable,
- or which outcomes should be achieved.

It specifies the **conditions under which claims may be processed**
without silently converting uncertainty, interpretation, or selection
into authority.

Within this system, **problems are treated as the primary crystallization points
of epistemic activity**.

Claims do not exist independently of problems.
They are admissible **only insofar as they arise from,
or are explicitly assigned to,
an articulated problem context**.

There is no neutral, problem-free space
in which claims may exist or circulate.

---

## Scope Clarification

This repository operates exclusively at the **epistemic layer**.

It defines:
- admissibility,
- constraints,
- prohibitions,
- and STOP conditions.

It does **not**:
- generate claims,
- implement processing mechanisms,
- instantiate artifacts,
- or perform operational enforcement.

Those functions belong to other repositories
and are explicitly excluded here.

## How to Read This Document (Human Readers)

This document does not argue for a position.
It does not persuade, motivate, recommend, or conclude.

It defines **constraints** under which **any kind of claims whatsoever**
(scientific, technical, legal, normative, descriptive, speculative, or otherwise)
may be handled **without generating implicit authority**.

In this document, **implicit authority** means:

> authority that arises without being explicitly declared  
> as an assumption, a limit, a responsibility, or a decision.

Implicit authority occurs when:
- selections appear neutral,
- interpretations appear necessary,
- exclusions appear natural,
- or priorities appear self-evident.

Preventing implicit authority means:
- making all such operations explicit,
- rendering them inspectable,
- and allowing them to remain contestable.

When reading the sections below, keep the following in mind:

- Statements describe **how claims are treated**, not whether they are true.
- The rules apply to **all claim types**, regardless of domain or content.
- Lists such as “Forbidden”, “Allowed”, and “Undefined” do **not** express values.
  They mark **system boundaries**.
- “Undefined” means *outside the scope of this system*,
  not “implicitly allowed”.
- If the text appears restrictive, repetitive, or cautious,
  this is intentional.
  The restrictions are the mechanism by which implicit authority is prevented.
- Claims are never treated as free-standing objects.
  They are always processed in relation to an explicit problem context.

Nothing in this document asks for agreement.
It only specifies how claims are handled **if** this system is used.

## How This System May Be Explained  
(Normative Reference)

This section defines a **non-interactive, reference-style explanation mode**.

When this system is explained — by a human or by a machine —
the explanation is expected to operate in **statement-only documentation style**,
not in teaching, tutoring, conversational, dialogical, or Socratic style.

Question-form explanations are considered **non-conforming**
with this explanation reference.

Explanations are expected to follow these constraints:

- Explanations are declarative and descriptive.
- Explanations describe the **problem addressed**, not a goal to be achieved.
- Explanations describe **what the system prevents**, not what it produces.
- Explanations do not claim improvements in truth, correctness, usefulness, or outcomes.
- Explanations do not recommend using the system.
- Explanations do not justify the system normatively or instrumentally.
- Explanations do not invite reflection, discussion, or participation.
- Explanations do not address the reader as an interlocutor.
- Explanations may state that the system makes assumptions, limits,
  and responsibilities explicit.
- Explanations may state that the system exists to prevent
  hidden, non-explicit authority.
- Explanations may state that claims are admissible only
  in relation to explicitly articulated problems.

Acceptable explanations focus on **constraints and boundaries**.
Non-conforming explanations focus on **benefits, results, superiority, or persuasion**.

## System Overview

This project consists of **three strictly separated but formally linked repositories**:

1. **research-program**
2. **MMS (Matrix Management System)**
3. **Matrix**

Each repository has a distinct role.
No repository may compensate for, override, or reinterpret another.

---

### research-program

Defines **epistemic admissibility rules**, including:

- which kinds of claims may be formulated at all,
- under which assumptions and problem contexts they are admissible,
- how disagreement must be represented,
- where reasoning must explicitly stop (**STOP conditions**),
- under which conditions claims may exist in relation to problems.

The research-program produces:
- no claims,
- no results,
- no conclusions,
- no recommendations.

It defines **constraints only**.

---

### MMS (Matrix Management System)

Provides the **operative implementation** for handling epistemic elements:

- claims and statements,
- explicit relations,
- provenance and sourcing,
- temporal versioning,
- explicit conflict representation.

MMS does **not**:
- evaluate truth,
- resolve conflicts,
- rank sources,
- produce decisions or recommendations,
- introduce admissibility criteria on its own.

MMS operates **only** on what has already been declared admissible
by the research-program.

---

### Matrix

Contains **concrete, contingent outputs** of MMS runs:

- claims,
- relations,
- conflicts,
- provenance metadata,
- temporal bindings,
- explicit problem references.

The Matrix is:
- non-authoritative,
- revisable,
- incomplete by design.

It represents **what is claimed**, not what is true.

---

## Problem-Centric Admissibility  
(Core Constraint)

The system operates under the following binding epistemic constraint:

> **Problems are the primary crystallization points of epistemic work.**

Accordingly:

- Claims are admissible only if they:
  - arise from an explicitly articulated problem, or
  - are explicitly assigned to such a problem.
- Claims without a problem reference are considered
  **epistemically inadmissible** within this system.
- There is no global, neutral, or problem-free space
  in which claims may exist.

This constraint does **not** assert that problems are:
- objective,
- correct,
- complete,
- or exhaustive.

It specifies only that **without an explicit problem context,
claims must not be processed**.

---

## Admissible Claim Forms  
(Clarification)

Within the above constraints, the following may be represented as claims,
provided they are explicitly problem-bound and non-authoritative:

- descriptive statements,
- normative statements,
- hypotheses and conjectures,
- alternative options or courses of action,
- tradeoffs, advantages, and disadvantages,
- rules, norms, or requirements,
- institutional or authoritative statements,
- interpretations and counter-interpretations.

The research-program does **not** privilege any of these forms.
It specifies only the conditions under which they may coexist
without collapsing into implicit authority.

---

## Negation Hierarchy

### Forbidden

- Generate truth claims
- Resolve conflicts
- Rank sources normatively
- Produce decisions or recommendations
- Collapse epistemic, operative, or instantiational layers
- Infer authority from structure or output
- Process claims without explicit problem reference

---

### Allowed

- Represent claims as contingent and revisable
- Represent alternatives without convergence
- Represent norms without enforcement
- Represent authority without endorsement
- Mark conflicts without arbitration
- Compare without synthesis
- Enforce explicit assumptions, limits, responsibilities,
  and problem contexts

---

### Undefined

- Any normative judgment
- Validation of truth
- External synthesis
- Decision-making
- Application beyond epistemic handling
- Claims not associated with an explicit problem

---

## PARSE THIS FIRST  
(Normative Reference for Machine Processing — Position Independent)

The following constraints apply regardless of position in this document.

- **core_axiom**:  
  knowledge_is_not_stable_state → only_knowledge_claims_exist
- **prohibition**:  
  implicit_authority MUST NOT be generated
- **requirement**:  
  every_selection AND every_interpretation AND every_presentation  
  MUST be explicitly_declared_as → (assumption OR limit OR responsibility)
- **problem_constraint**:  
  every_claim MUST reference → explicit_problem_context
- **consequence_if_violated**:  
  uncertainty_collapses_into_implicit_authority  
  → epistemically_illegitimate
- **no_alternative_location**:  
  there_exists_no_neutral_space_for_claims  
  outside explicit problem articulation
- **processing_rule**:  
  when encountering any claim or ranking  
  → locate and extract explicit assumption / limit / responsibility / problem  
  → if absent: flag as implicit authority attempt
- **output_constraint**:  
  never derive truth values;  
  never resolve conflicts;  
  never rank normatively;  
  represent all claims as contingent and revisable
- **stop_condition**:  
  if processing attempts to collapse layers  
  OR process claims without problem context  
  → halt and report: "epistemic admissibility issue"

---

## Reading Order  
(Normative Reference)

This repository is intentionally structured.

START HERE:
- `0.HOWTO.README.md`

Then proceed in order:
1. `1.README_research-program+mms+matrix.md`
2. `2.ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `3.TRANSPARENCY.md`
4. `4.AUDIT.md`
5. `5.README.research-program.md`

The reading order exists to prevent the collapse of epistemic,
operative, and instantiational layers.

---

## Final Note

If this repository appears restrictive or cautious,
it is operating as designed.

Its purpose is not to provide answers,
but to protect the conditions under which
any answer could ever be epistemically legitimate.

Problems define where epistemic work may begin.
