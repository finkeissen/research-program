## Research Program — Epistemic Architecture

**Status:** Applied Research  
**Current Context:** 0.5 (stresstest)  
**Binding Context:** 0.4 (guardrails, closed)  
**Authority:** None  

---

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **structured research program**.

It is not a product, not a system, and not an authority.
It is a **thinking and translation space** whose primary purpose is to make
**assumptions, scopes, constraints, boundaries, interfaces, and stopping conditions explicit**.

The repository exists to answer questions of the form:

- What exactly is being claimed, and in which domain?
- Under which conditions does a statement hold?
- Which assumptions and constraints are in play — and which are explicitly excluded?
- What kind of evidence would be required to proceed?
- Where does reasoning legitimately stop?
- When is STOP the only correct outcome?

This repository prioritizes **epistemic discipline over completeness**.

---

## 2. Epistemic Contexts and Their Roles

The research program is organized into **epistemic contexts**.

An epistemic context defines the **conditions under which reasoning is permitted**.
Contexts are **not phases, levels, or maturity stages**.
They do not imply progress, improvement, or increased authority.

Multiple contexts may remain valid simultaneously.
Changing context means changing **rules of admissibility**, not truth.

---

### Context 0.1 — Exploration (closed)

- open search space
- unfiltered exploration
- early boundary intuition
- no architectural guarantees

---

### Context 0.2 — Structural Extraction (closed)

- identification of stable structures
- separation of form and content
- emergence of interfaces, boundaries, and schemas
- still non-applied and non-domain-specific

---

### Context 0.3 — Constraints (closed)

- **conditional and provisional use** of extracted structure
- explicit constraints on applicability
- domain-specific limitations without authority
- usage is allowed, but never validated or endorsed

---

### Context 0.4 — Guardrails (closed, binding)

- system-wide, non-negotiable boundaries
- protection of epistemic integrity
- explicit STOP conditions
- integrity-defining limits

Context 0.4 is **closed**, but **binding**.
No subsequent context may violate these guardrails.

---

### Context 0.5 — Stresstest (current)

- systematic pressure-testing of the architecture
- exposure to high conflict density and ambiguity
- confrontation with empirical and normative stressors
- validation through failure, conflict, or STOP

Resolution is **not required**.
Failure is an acceptable outcome.

---

## 3. What Context 0.4 Represents

Context **0.4** represents a **structurally complete epistemic architecture**.

It consolidates all prior contexts into a coherent framework that is:

- internally consistent
- explicitly bounded
- domain-capable
- non-authoritative by design

Context 0.4 completes the **epistemic and architectural groundwork**
of the research program.

It deliberately does **not** introduce:

- external empirical constraints
- ontological commitments
- world models
- unifying explanations
- authoritative decision logic

All such extensions are intentionally deferred.

---

## 4. Domains as Interpretation Spaces

Domains in this repository function as **interpretation spaces**.

An interpretation space:

- hosts **multiple, potentially incompatible models or teaching positions**
- makes assumptions and scopes explicit
- allows comparison, contrast, and critique
- carries **no authority** and **no decision power**

Domains are **not**:

- authoritative knowledge bases
- operational specifications
- product-ready artifacts
- commitments to a single worldview

They exist to support **research discourse**, not to drive decisions.

No domain content is suitable for direct operational use.

---

## 5. What This Repository Is

This repository **is**:

- a structured research and translation environment
- a framework for making assumptions, scopes, and constraints explicit
- a space for hosting interpretation spaces without collapsing them into a shared ontology
- a preparation layer for later systems that must still re-derive their own contracts

The repository supports exploration and constrained use
**without implicit authority**.

---

## 6. What This Repository Is Not

This repository **is not**:

- a reference architecture
- a domain ontology
- an expert system
- a decision-making authority
- a policy, legal, or ethics engine
- suitable for production, automation, or delegation
- a world model
- stable or backward-compatible

No content here should be used directly for:

- implementation
- optimization
- automation
- real-world decision-making

---

## 7. Constraints vs. Guardrails

A key distinction in this research program is the difference between
**constraints** and **guardrails**.

### Constraints (Context 0.3)

- apply to **use and application**
- are local and context-dependent
- may vary across domains
- can be replaced or refined
- restrict *what may be done*

Violating a constraint invalidates the **use**,
but does not invalidate the research framework.

---

### Guardrails (Context 0.4)

- apply to the **research program itself**
- are system-wide and non-negotiable
- define epistemic integrity
- enforce STOP or require a context transition
- restrict *what may be meaningfully asserted or extended*

Violating a guardrail does not produce an error —
it marks a **hard STOP**.

---

## 8. STOP — Scope, Limits, and Context Integrity

**STOP** is a first-class structural concept of this research program.

STOP is not a failure, an error, or a lack of knowledge.

> **STOP is an explicit boundary at which this research program cannot proceed
> without violating its own epistemic rules.**

STOP functions as a **guardrail**.

Any step beyond these limits requires a **context transition**, not an extension.

---

## 9. Relationship to MMS and Governance Work

This repository does **not** define:

- MMS
- governance structures
- authority models
- responsibility assignments
- operational procedures

It may inform later systems, but:

> No element of this repository is authoritative for decisions.

Any operational or governance system must
explicitly re-derive its own contracts, assumptions, and responsibilities.

There is no implicit handover.

---

## 10. Context Philosophy

- Contexts define **conditions of admissibility**, not progress.
- Contexts may coexist.
- Earlier contexts remain valid in their own terms.
- Later contexts may fail without invalidating earlier ones.

Changing context means changing **rules**, not outcomes.

---

## 11. Final Note

If this repository feels careful, constrained, and sometimes frustrating,
that is intentional.

The core research question remains unchanged:

> “Under which conditions would an answer even be legitimate —
> and in which domain?”

The research program exists to protect that question
from being answered too easily.
