## Purpose of This Document

This document makes explicit:

- what is disclosed,
- what is deliberately not disclosed,
- which assumptions shape the research-program, MMS, and the Matrix,
- where alternatives are possible, legitimate, and expected,
- how disclosure interacts with authority risk.

It does **not** serve to:
- create trust,
- establish authority,
- legitimize decisions,
- imply correctness or completeness.

Transparency here is **not a promise of truth**.
It is a **mechanism for contestability, critique,
and counter-design**.

---

## Guiding Principle

> **The more productive a system becomes,
> the higher the transparency requirements
> for its assumptions and limits.**

Because this bundle produces a **productive artifact (the Matrix)**,
**MMS and the Matrix** are subject to stricter transparency requirements
than the fully non-productive research-program.

This principle does not imply desirability or endorsement of productivity.
It specifies **risk exposure**.

---

## Layer-Specific Transparency

### 1. research-program (epistemic, non-productive)

The research-program is structurally **non-productive**
and therefore **maximally neutral**.

**Disclosed:**
- epistemic concepts and interfaces,
- admissibility conditions,
- guardrails and STOP conditions,
- responsibility boundaries,
- problem-centric admissibility constraints.

**Not disclosed:**
- domain-specific content,
- factual claims,
- evaluations or rankings,
- implementation or operational details.

**Rationale:**
Neutrality requires the absence of
implicit outcomes, targets, or problem solutions.

---

### 2. MMS (operative, productive implementation)

MMS is a **specific implementation**
derived from the research-program
and is therefore **not itself neutral**.

**Disclosed:**
- overall system architecture,
- data models and record structures,
- provenance and versioning logic,
- conflict marking rules,
- explicit validation and error classes.

**Partially disclosed:**
- prompt structures (abstracted),
- extraction heuristics (conceptual level).

**Not disclosed:**
- full prompt texts,
- security-relevant system instructions,
- protections against prompt injection,
- model- and parameter-specific configurations.

**Rationale:**
- protection against targeted manipulation,
- security and privacy requirements,
- avoidance of system fingerprinting,
- auditability without enabling attack optimization.

Non-disclosure is **explicit, reasoned, and contestable**.

---

## 3. The Matrix (Instantiated Output)

The **Matrix** is the **productive result** of MMS
and is therefore **explicitly contingent**.

**Disclosed:**
- claim–source structures,
- conflict status and relations,
- temporal bindings,
- version histories,
- provenance metadata,
- explicit problem references.

**Not guaranteed:**
- completeness,
- timeliness,
- internal consistency,
- representativeness,
- cross-problem coherence.

The Matrix is:
- **not a reference standard**,
- **not an authoritative knowledge base**,
- **not a truth repository**.

It is a **record of articulated claims under constraints**,
not an answer-producing system.

---

## Transparency and Authority Risk

Transparency alone does **not** prevent authority formation.

Even fully disclosed systems may generate
epistemic authority through:

- formal representation,
- aggregation and visualization,
- repetition and comparative framing,
- institutional or habitual use,
- interface and presentation design.

For this reason, authority pressure is treated
as a **structural risk**, not a communication failure.

The architectural response is therefore
not unlimited disclosure,
but **explicit limitation, context separation,
problem-centric admissibility,
and enforced STOP conditions**.

---

## Context 0.5 — Transparency Under Maximum Authority Pressure

In **epistemic context 0.5 (stress-test)**,
authority pressure is deliberately amplified.

High-authority domains
(e.g. physics, law, medicine)
are used to expose:

- where transparency alone is insufficient,
- where representation tips into authority,
- where problem articulation breaks down,
- where STOP is the only admissible response.

These stress-tests:
- do not alter global principles,
- do not introduce new rules,
- do not privilege any domain.

They exist solely to **evaluate architectural robustness**.

---

## Publication Status of the Matrix

The Matrix exists **conceptually and operationally**.

Its **publication form is deliberately open**
and is **not a maturity or quality indicator**:

- no mandatory standalone repository,
- internal, selective, or domain-specific use is legitimate,
- public release (e.g. via GitHub) is optional.

Non-publication is **not a deficiency**,
but a **context-dependent, legitimate state**.

Publication decisions are:
- not epistemic,
- but legal, organizational, and situational.

---

## Contingency as a Design Principle

This project does not claim:

> “This is how the world is.”

It claims only:

> “This is how things appear
> under these assumptions,
> within these problem articulations,
> using this implementation,
> at this point in time.”

From this it explicitly follows:

- alternative MMS implementations are legitimate,
- alternative extraction logics are legitimate,
- alternative conflict models are legitimate,
- alternative Matrices are legitimate.

**Counter-designs are not failures,
but an intended outcome of the architecture.**

---

## Known Structural Tensions

The following tensions are **structural and persistent**:

- scalability vs. conflict sensitivity,
- model quality vs. reproducibility,
- disclosure vs. manipulation risk,
- productivity vs. epistemic neutrality,
- cross-problem integration vs. local coherence.

These tensions are not to be resolved,
but to remain **visible and explicit**.


---

## Epistemic Abysses (Non-Resolvable States)

Within this architecture, certain situations are not merely difficult,
underspecified, or temporarily unresolved.

They are **structurally non-resolvable**.

These situations are referred to here as **epistemic abysses**.

An epistemic abyss is reached when:

- incompatible problem articulations cannot be reconciled
  without introducing implicit authority,
- constraints are mutually exclusive but equally binding,
- responsibility cannot be assigned without presupposing a decision,
- interpretation itself becomes the primary source of authority,
- or further structuring would require collapsing epistemic layers.

Epistemic abysses are:

- not errors,
- not failures of modeling,
- not missing data,
- not implementation limitations.

They are **legitimate terminal states**
under the admissibility rules of this research program.

When an epistemic abyss is reached:

- STOP is the only admissible outcome,
- no approximation or compromise is allowed,
- silence is structurally correct,
- continuation requires an explicit context transition
  or an external decision under separate responsibility.

This document does not attempt to resolve epistemic abysses.
It exists to ensure that they remain **visible, nameable,
and non-deniable**.

---


## Transparency of Dependencies

The following dependencies are explicit
and structurally constitutive:

- dependence on LLM quality and behavior,
- model changes alter Matrix contents,
- extraction is non-deterministic,
- prompt stability is limited over time.

These dependencies are **not implementation flaws**,
but acknowledged characteristics of the system.

---

## Transparency ≠ Convenience

This project is **deliberately inconvenient**.

It provides:
- no single answers,
- no rankings,
- no default positions,
- no synthesized conclusions.

Convenience must be created **outside this bundle**,
under explicit and separate responsibility.

---

## Relationship to Trust

This project does **not require trust**.

It requires:
- reading,
- understanding,
- critique,
- counter-design.

Trust is **optional**,
not a prerequisite for engagement.

## Structural Update: Introduction of a Formal Topic Intake Process

**Change type:** Structural clarification  
**Scope:** Research Program  
**Date:** 2026-02-10

### Description

A formal process for introducing new topics into the research program
has been explicitly defined and documented.

New topics are now required to be introduced **first at the research-program level**
before any consideration of operational systems (MMS, matrix, tools).
This process defines minimal documentation requirements, explicit status labels,
and a non-automatic transition boundary toward operationalization.

### Motivation

This clarification was introduced to:
- prevent implicit or premature operationalization of new topics,
- ensure semantic and epistemic consistency before structural reuse,
- make the handling of new topics auditable and reproducible,
- protect the research program from authority creep via downstream systems.

### Impact

- No existing topics were modified.
- No epistemic content, claims, or assumptions were added.
- No operational systems were changed.

The update affects **process transparency only** and does not alter
the epistemic guardrails, constraints, or admissibility rules of the system.

### Authority Statement

The research program remains authoritative with respect to:
- the admissibility of topics,
- their scope and status,
- and the conditions under which a transition to MMS may occur.

Downstream systems (MMS, matrix) must not introduce implicit changes
to the research program as a consequence of this update.


## Final Note

> Transparency here does not mean
> revealing everything,
> but making **everything contestable
> and every non-disclosure accountable**.

What remains undisclosed
remains **explicitly bounded**
and **open to challenge**.
