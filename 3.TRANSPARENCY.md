## Purpose of This Document

This document makes explicit:

- what is disclosed
- what is deliberately not disclosed
- which assumptions shape MMS and the Matrix
- where alternatives are possible, legitimate, and expected

It does **not** serve to:
- create trust
- establish authority
- legitimize decisions

Transparency here is **not a promise of correctness**,
but an **active invitation to critique, disagreement,
and counter-design**.

---

## Guiding Principle

> **The more productive a system becomes,
> the higher the transparency requirements
> for its assumptions.**

Because this bundle produces a **productive result (the Matrix)**,
**MMS and the Matrix** are subject to stricter transparency requirements
than the fully neutral research-program.

---

## Layer-Specific Transparency

### 1. research-program (epistemic, fully neutral)

**Disclosed:**
- concepts and interfaces
- admissibility conditions
- responsibility boundaries
- failure modes
- STOP and handover rules

**Not disclosed:**
- domain-specific content
- facts
- evaluations
- implementation details

**Rationale:**
Full neutrality requires that
no implicit outcomes or target states are embedded.

---

### 2. MMS (operative, concrete implementation)

MMS is a **specific implementation**
of the neutral research-program
and is therefore **not itself neutral**.

**Disclosed:**
- overall architecture
- data models
- provenance logic
- conflict marking rules
- versioning strategies

**Partially disclosed:**
- prompt structures (abstracted)
- extraction heuristics (conceptual)

**Not disclosed:**
- full prompt texts
- security-relevant system instructions
- protection mechanisms against prompt injection
- model- and parameter-specific configurations

**Rationale:**
- protection against targeted manipulation
- data protection and privacy requirements
- avoidance of system fingerprinting
- auditability without attack optimization

---

## The Matrix (Product)

The **Matrix** is the **productive result** of MMS
and is therefore **explicitly contingent**.

**Disclosed:**
- claim × source structures
- conflict status
- temporal binding
- version histories
- provenance metadata

**Not guaranteed:**
- completeness
- timeliness
- consistency
- representativeness

The Matrix is:
- **not a reference standard**
- **not an authoritative knowledge base**
- **not a truth repository**

It is a **structured basis for working under disagreement**,
not for resolving it.

---

## Transparency and Authority Risk

Transparency alone does **not** prevent authority formation.

Even fully disclosed systems can produce
epistemic authority through:

- formal presentation
- aggregation and visualization
- repetition and comparison
- institutional use
- interface and presentation design

For this reason, the project treats
**authority pressure as a structural risk**,
not as a communication problem.

The architectural response is therefore
not unlimited disclosure,
but **explicit limitation, context separation,
and enforced STOP conditions**.

---

## Context 0.5 — Transparency Under Maximum Authority Pressure

In **epistemic context 0.5 (stress-test)**,
this risk is deliberately amplified.

High-authority domains
(e.g. physics, law, medicine)
are used to expose:

- where transparency alone is insufficient
- where representation tips into authority
- where STOP is the only valid response

These stress-tests:
- do not alter global principles
- do not introduce new rules
- do not privilege any domain

They exist solely to **evaluate the architecture**.

---

## Publication Status of the Matrix

The Matrix exists **conceptually and operationally**.

Its **publication form is deliberately open**
and is **not a quality or maturity indicator**:

- no required standalone repository
- internal, selective, or domain-specific use is legitimate
- public release (e.g. on GitHub) is optional

Non-publication is **not a deficiency**,
but a **legitimate, context-dependent state**.

The publication decision is:
- not epistemic
- but legal, organizational, and situational

---

## Contingency as a Design Principle

This project does not claim:

> “This is how the world is.”

It claims only:

> “This is how things appear
> under these assumptions,
> with this implementation,
> at this point in time.”

From this it explicitly follows:

- alternative MMS implementations are legitimate
- alternative extraction logics are legitimate
- alternative conflict models are legitimate
- alternative Matrices are legitimate

**Counter-designs are not failures,
but an intended outcome of the architecture.**

---

## Known Structural Tensions

These tensions are **not solvable**,
but must remain **visible and active**:

- scalability vs. conflict sensitivity
- model quality vs. reproducibility
- disclosure vs. manipulation risk
- productivity vs. neutrality

---

## Transparency of Dependencies

The following dependencies are explicit
and structurally constitutive:

- dependence on LLM quality
- model changes alter Matrix contents
- extraction is non-deterministic
- prompt stability is limited

These dependencies are **not implementation flaws**,
but part of the system design.

---

## Transparency ≠ Convenience

This project is **deliberately inconvenient**:

- no single answers
- no evidence ranking
- no default positions

Convenience must be created **outside this bundle**,
under explicit and separate responsibility.

---

## Relationship to Trust

This project does **not require trust**.

It requires:
- reading
- understanding
- critique
- counter-design

Trust is **optional**,
not a prerequisite for use.

---

## Final Note

> Transparency here does not mean
> revealing everything,
> but making **everything contestable
> and every non-disclosure accountable**.

What remains open stays open —
and **must be justified**.
