# Quantization

## Scope

This document specifies the meaning of **quantization**
as used throughout the research program.

Quantization is not used here
in a technical or physical sense,
but in a **strictly epistemic sense**.

It applies to all domains,
all forms of research,
and all downstream systems.

## From Continuity to Discreteness

The world is continuous, ambiguous, and overdetermined.

Cognition cannot operate on such continuity directly.

Research becomes possible only when
continuity is transformed into discreteness.

This transformation is called **quantization**.

---

## Quantization as Problem Formation

Quantization occurs at the moment
a problem is formulated.

To formulate a problem means:

- to draw a boundary
- to define discrete states
- to distinguish what counts from what does not
- to eliminate intermediate possibilities

A problem is therefore
a **quantized view of reality**.

---

## Maximal Quantization

Problem formation is a **maximal quantization**.

There is no stronger simplification
that still allows meaningful work.

Any further reduction
does not simplify the problem,
but destroys it.

Below this threshold,
there is no problem—only raw material.

---

## Irreversibility

Quantization is irreversible
at the level of the problem.

Once a problem is formulated:

- excluded aspects cannot be recovered
- continuity cannot be restored
- ambiguity cannot be reintroduced
  without reformulating the problem itself

All work proceeds
under this irreversible constraint.

## Quantization and Responsibility

Because quantization is a cut,
it produces loss.

This loss is unavoidable,
but it is not neutral.

Responsibility in research means:

- accepting the consequences of the quantization
- acknowledging what has been excluded
- resisting claims beyond the quantized scope

Responsibility begins
at the moment of quantization.

---

## Relation to Theories and Paradigms

Theories and paradigms do not remove quantization.

They:
- enable certain forms of quantization
- stabilize specific cuts
- make some problems easy
- make others impossible

In this sense,
theories are **quantization frameworks**,
not representations of reality.

---

## Relation to Downstream Systems

Downstream systems
operate on already-quantized problems.

They may refine, analyze, or solve,
but they do not undo quantization.

Quantization is the entry condition,
not a processing step.

---

## Closure

Quantization is not a methodological option.

It is the price paid
for making the world thinkable.

As long as cognition is limited
and the world is not,
quantization is unavoidable.
