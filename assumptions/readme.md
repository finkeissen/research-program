# Research Program

This repository defines the epistemic preconditions
under which research is possible at all.

It does not contain theories, models, or results.

It defines the **structural relationship**
between a large world and a small mind.

---

## Large World, Small Mind

The world is continuous, overdetermined, and richer
than any representation.

Human cognition is limited, discrete, and selective.

Research exists only because this mismatch exists.

---

## Quantization as a Necessity

Every act of research requires a maximal simplification:
a cut that turns continuity into discreteness.

This cut is called a **problem**.

Without this quantization:
- no question can be asked
- no solution can be formulated
- no responsibility can be taken

---

## Role of Theories and Paradigms

Theories, paradigms, and classifications
do not describe the world.

They prepare the ground
on which problems can be formulated.

They are preconditions, not conclusions.

---

## No Prescription

This research program does not prescribe:
- what to research
- which theory to use
- which method to apply

It only states:
**without explicit reduction, research is not possible.**

---

## Relation to Downstream Systems

Concrete problems, solutions, and evaluations
are handled elsewhere.

This repository defines
the epistemic ground on which such systems can exist.

## Relationship Between Topics and Assumptions

Not every new topic introduced into the research program
automatically introduces new assumptions.

Assumptions are **exceptional artifacts**.
They exist only where reasoning would otherwise
silently rely on unstated premises.

### When a New Topic DOES NOT Require New Assumptions

A new topic does **not** require new assumptions if it:

- operates entirely within existing epistemic rules,
- introduces no new ontological commitments,
- does not alter admissibility conditions,
- does not redefine problem articulation,
- does not weaken or bypass existing guardrails,
- and does not introduce implicit defaults.

In such cases, the topic is considered
**assumption-neutral** at introduction time.

Exploratory topics are **assumption-free by default**
unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### When a New Topic REQUIRES Explicit Assumptions

A new topic requires explicit assumptions if it:

- relies on premises not defined elsewhere in the research program,
- presupposes a particular interpretation of evidence, causality, or agency,
- introduces new boundary conditions or scope restrictions,
- requires exclusions that are not already covered by guardrails,
- would otherwise change the admissibility of claims implicitly.

In these cases, assumptions must be:
- explicitly documented,
- scoped to the topic or context,
- clearly marked as contingent,
- and open to contestation.

---

### Non-Transfer Rule

Assumptions introduced for a specific topic:

- do not automatically apply to other topics,
- do not generalize across domains,
- do not propagate into MMS or the Matrix implicitly.

Any reuse of an assumption
requires explicit re-adoption and justification.

---

### Authority Clarification

Assumptions do **not** grant authority.
They restrict reasoning.

An assumption does not validate a topic.
It only makes explicit
which forms of reasoning would otherwise be implicit.

Undocumented assumptions are treated as **epistemic violations**,
not as acceptable shortcuts.
