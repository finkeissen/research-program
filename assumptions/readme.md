# Research Program

This repository defines the epistemic preconditions
under which research is possible at all.

It does not contain theories, models, or results.

It defines the **structural relationship**
between a large world and a small mind.

---

## Large World, Small Mind

The world is continuous, overdetermined, and richer
than any representation.

Human cognition is limited, discrete, and selective.

Research exists only because this mismatch exists.

---

## Quantization as a Necessity

Every act of research requires a maximal simplification:
a cut that turns continuity into discreteness.

This cut is called a **problem**.

Without this quantization:
- no question can be asked
- no solution can be formulated
- no responsibility can be taken

---

## Role of Theories and Paradigms

Theories, paradigms, and classifications
do not describe the world.

They prepare the ground
on which problems can be formulated.

They are preconditions, not conclusions.

---

## No Prescription

This research program does not prescribe:
- what to research
- which theory to use
- which method to apply

It only states:
**without explicit reduction, research is not possible.**

---

## Relation to Downstream Systems

Concrete problems, solutions, and evaluations
are handled elsewhere.

This repository defines
the epistemic ground on which such systems can exist.
