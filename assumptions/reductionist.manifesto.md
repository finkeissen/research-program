# Reductionist Manifesto

## Scope

This manifesto applies to the entire research program
and to all downstream systems that rely on it.

It defines a foundational epistemic position:
**reduction is unavoidable**.

---

## Reduction as a Condition of Knowledge

There is no direct, complete, or lossless access
to reality through language, logic, mathematics,
or formal structure.

Every act of knowing requires reduction.

Reduction is not a methodological choice.
It is a structural necessity.

---

## Problems as Reductions

A problem is not discovered in reality.
A problem is **constructed** through reduction.

To formulate a problem means:
- selecting certain aspects
- ignoring others
- fixing boundaries
- accepting loss

Without reduction, there is no problem.
Without a problem, there is no research.

---

## Solutions Do Not Undo Reduction

Solutions do not reverse reduction.

They:
- operate within the boundaries of a problem
- inherit its assumptions
- accept its losses

Every solution is therefore
a **continuation of reduction**, not its negation.

---

## Theories and Models

Theories and models are not exceptions.

They are:
- structured systems of reduction
- historically contingent
- context-dependent
- limited in scope

In the best case,
they are powerful and consistent problem solutions.

They are not representations of reality
and must not be treated as such.

---

## Loss Is Unavoidable

Every reduction produces loss:
- loss of context
- loss of continuity
- loss of alternatives
- loss of ambiguity

This loss is:
- epistemically problematic
- practically unavoidable

Any system that hides this loss
implicitly claims authority.

---

## Obligation of Explicitness

Because reduction cannot be avoided,
it must be made explicit.

This research program therefore requires:
- reductions to be visible
- assumptions to be stated
- boundaries to be acknowledged
- scope to be limited

Implicit reduction is unacceptable.

---

## No Privileged Position

There is:
- no privileged theory
- no neutral model
- no final framework
- no authoritative perspective

All positions are reductions.
They differ only in structure, scope, and usefulness.

---

## Conclusion

Reduction is not a flaw.
It is the condition of possibility for research.

Unmarked reduction, however,
is an implicit claim to truth
and is therefore rejected by this program.
