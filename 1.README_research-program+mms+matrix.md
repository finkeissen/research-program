# research-program + MMS + Matrix  
## Layered Epistemic Architecture

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **explicit relationship** between the three repositories:

- **research-program**
- **MMS (Matrix Management System)**
- **Matrix**

Its sole purpose is to prevent:
- category errors,
- layer collapse,
- implicit authority transfer,
- and hidden normativity across layers.

This document does **not** define:
- truth criteria
- implementation details
- operational workflows
- evaluation or ranking logic
- decision procedures

It specifies **interfaces, boundaries, and non-transfer rules**.

---

## The Core Separation Principle

The architecture is based on a **strict three-layer separation**:

| Layer | Role | Authority |
|------|------|-----------|
| research-program | epistemic admissibility | none |
| MMS | operative handling | none |
| Matrix | instantiated claims | none |

No layer may:
- inherit authority from another,
- compensate for missing constraints upstream,
- or introduce rules that belong to a different layer.

---

## Layer 1 — research-program (Epistemic Layer)

The research-program defines **epistemic admissibility rules**.

It determines:
- which kinds of claims may exist at all,
- under which assumptions and problem contexts they are admissible,
- how disagreement must be represented,
- which operations are epistemically forbidden,
- and where reasoning must explicitly stop (**STOP**).

It explicitly defines:
- guardrails (binding, non-negotiable),
- constraints (context-dependent),
- STOP conditions,
- problem-centric admissibility.

It explicitly does **not**:
- generate claims
- validate truth
- rank evidence
- resolve conflict
- recommend actions
- produce outputs

The research-program is **purely normative at the epistemic level**
and **non-authoritative by design**.

---

## Layer 2 — MMS (Matrix Management System)

MMS is the **operative layer**.

It implements mechanisms to:
- register claims as records,
- represent relations explicitly,
- attach provenance and sourcing,
- version changes over time,
- mark conflicts and inconsistencies,
- enforce declared constraints mechanically.

MMS:
- does not decide which claims are allowed to exist,
- does not judge epistemic legitimacy,
- does not evaluate correctness or usefulness,
- does not resolve conflicts,
- does not infer authority from structure.

MMS operates **only on what has already been declared admissible**
by the research-program.

Any MMS validation rule:
- must be traceable to an explicit research-program constraint,
- must be mechanically checkable,
- must never introduce new epistemic norms.

MMS failures are **operational**, not epistemic.

---

## Layer 3 — Matrix (Instantiational Layer)

The Matrix contains **concrete, contingent outputs** of MMS runs.

It consists of:
- claims
- relations
- conflicts
- provenance metadata
- temporal bindings
- explicit problem references

The Matrix:
- represents what is claimed,
- does not assert what is true,
- does not resolve disagreement,
- does not converge positions,
- does not synthesize conclusions.

Matrix artifacts are:
- non-authoritative,
- revisable,
- incomplete by design,
- historically bound.

The Matrix is **not a knowledge base**.
It is a **record of articulated claims under explicit constraints**.

---

## Clarification — Scope of Instantiated Claims (Non-Exhaustive)

Within the Matrix, claims may represent, without distinction or privilege:

- descriptive statements,
- normative statements,
- alternative options or courses of action,
- advantages, disadvantages, and tradeoffs,
- rules, norms, or requirements,
- institutional or authoritative statements,
- interpretations and counter-interpretations.

Such claims do **not** acquire authority by representation.
They remain contingent, problem-bound artifacts
whose coexistence does not imply endorsement,
evaluation, enforcement, or resolution.

This clarification introduces no new admissibility criteria
and does not alter the responsibilities of any layer.

---

## Problem-Centric Flow Across Layers

A binding architectural invariant applies across all layers:

> **No epistemic element may exist without an explicit problem context.**

Accordingly:

- The research-program defines problem-centric admissibility.
- MMS enforces the presence of declared problem references
  where required by the admissibility rules.
- The Matrix records problem-bound claims explicitly.

There is no global, neutral, or problem-free space
for claims in any layer.

Integration between problems, if required,
constitutes a **new problem**,
not a global abstraction.

---

## Authority and Responsibility Boundaries

Authority is explicitly excluded at all layers.

- The research-program defines rules, not outcomes.
- MMS enforces structure, not legitimacy.
- The Matrix records artifacts, not truth.

Responsibility is **local and explicit**:
- epistemic responsibility lies in the research-program,
- operational responsibility lies in MMS,
- interpretive responsibility lies outside the system.

There is no implicit delegation of responsibility.

---

## Failure Modes and STOP Propagation

Failures are treated differently across layers:

- **Epistemic violation** → STOP (research-program)
- **Operational violation** → error / rejection (MMS)
- **Contradiction or conflict** → representation (Matrix)

No layer may:
- silently repair failures,
- reinterpret violations,
- or bypass STOP through approximation.

STOP propagates **downward**.
Errors do not propagate **upward**.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

This architecture does not aim to:
- optimize workflows
- accelerate discovery
- improve correctness
- converge opinions
- support decisions
- produce consensus
- reduce complexity

Any such goal must be pursued **outside**
this architecture and **without importing authority back into it**.

---

## Final Boundary Statement

This architecture exists to ensure that:

> **Claims can be handled without being silently transformed
> into authority.**

It achieves this by:
- strict layer separation,
- explicit problem-centric admissibility,
- non-negotiable guardrails,
- and the structural acceptance of disagreement and STOP.

Any deviation from these principles
invalidates the architecture,
not merely a component.
