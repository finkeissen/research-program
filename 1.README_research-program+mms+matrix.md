## Purpose of This Document

This document is the **architecture contract of the bundle**.

It describes:
- roles and responsibilities of the repositories
- their coupling and separation
- the point **where neutrality ends**
- and **where product responsibility begins**

It does **not** explain what is true,
but **how responsibility, processing, and productivity are separated**.

---

## Guiding Vision

The bundle develops the **epistemic and operative foundations of an operating system for the macro-organism “world.”**

Not as a world formula.
Not as a truth machine.

But as an **anti-totalizing infrastructure**
with an **explicit, transparent product: the Matrix**.

---

## The Repository Cascade

The bundle is organized as a **cascade of instantiations**:

Bootloader (conceptual, → research-program)
→ research-program (epistemic kernel, fully neutral), https://github.com/finkeissen/research-program
→ MMS (operative implementation, one concrete implementation), https://github.com/finkeissen/mms
→ Matrix (instantiational knowledge base, product), https://github.com/finkeissen/matrix
→ Individual decisions / planning / economy (external)

With each stage, **specificity increases**,
but **epistemic authority never does**.

Neutrality applies **exclusively** to the research-program.

## Transition to the Reference Architecture

The **canonical fixation** of all terms, layers,
and responsibilities can be found in:

→ `2.ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Further Documents

The reading order is binding:

1. `0.HOWTO.README.md`
2. `1.README_research-program+mms+matrix.md`
3. `2.ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `3.TRANSPARENCY.md`
5. `4.AUDIT.md`
6. `5.README.research-program.md`

## Final Note

> This document describes **architecture and product line**,
> not the world.

It marks:
- where neutrality ends
- where responsibility begins
- and where counter-designs are explicitly intended.
