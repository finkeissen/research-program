## System Goals (Canonical)

This repository bundle consists of **three strictly separated layers**.
Each layer has a **clear, limited, and non-overlapping purpose**.

### 1. research-program — Rules for Legitimate Scientific Reasoning

The **research-program** defines the rules under which
**scientific reasoning is admissible**.

It specifies:
- which kinds of claims may be formulated at all
- under which assumptions and epistemic contexts they are admissible
- how disagreement and conflict must be represented
- and where reasoning must explicitly stop (STOP)

The research-program:
- produces **no knowledge**
- produces **no results**
- produces **no conclusions**

It defines the **conditions of legitimacy for science**,
not its outcomes.

---

### 2. MMS — Operative Management System for Epistemic Elements

The **Matrix Management System (MMS)** is the **operative implementation for knowledge management**
of the research-program.

MMS can be understood as a **DBMS-like system** for:
- epistemic elements (claims, statements)
- their explicit relations
- provenance and sourcing
- temporal versioning
- and marked conflicts

MMS deliberately does **not**:
- validate truth
- resolve conflicts
- rank sources
- produce decisions or recommendations

MMS implements **handling rules**, not truth rules,
strictly derived from the research-program.
MMS is not neutral; it is a concrete, rule-bound implementation.
What remains non-negotiable is that it produces no truth, no rankings, and no decisions.

---

### 3. Matrix — Concrete Instantiation of Epistemic Elements

The **Matrix** is the **concrete, instantiational product**
generated by an MMS run.

It consists of:
- epistemic elements (claims, statements)
- their explicit relations
- marked conflicts
- temporal bindings
- provenance metadata

The Matrix is:
- contingent
- revisable
- incomplete by design
- non-authoritative

It represents:
> what is claimed, by whom, when,
> under which assumptions,
> and in conflict with what

It does **not** represent truth
and does **not** justify decisions.
It consists of structured state of claims (with provenance, time, relations, and conflicts),
not a state of knowledge.

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document is the **architecture contract of the repository bundle**.

It defines:
- roles and responsibilities of the repositories
- their coupling and separation
- the point **where neutrality ends**
- and **where product responsibility begins**

It does **not** explain what is true,
but **how responsibility, processing, and productivity are separated**.

---

## Guiding Vision

The bundle develops the **epistemic and operative foundations of an operating system for the macro-organism “world.”**

Not as a world formula.
Not as a truth machine.

But as an **anti-totalizing infrastructure** that
> structures research questions and competing claims
> exposes logic and assumptions transparently
> produces an explicit, inspectable product: the Matrix**.

---

## The Repository Cascade

The bundle is organized as a **cascade of instantiations**:

Bootloader (conceptual starting point of logical thinking, → research-program)
→ Research-Program (epistemic kernel, requirements, maximal neutral), https://github.com/finkeissen/research-program
→ Matrix Management System (MMS, operative implementation for knowledge-management — code and prompts — for epistemically structured statements), https://github.com/finkeissen/mms
→ Matrix (instantiational knowledge representation, product), https://github.com/finkeissen/matrix
→ Individual decisions / planning / economy (external)

With each stage, **specificity increases**,
but **epistemic authority never does**.

Neutrality applies **exclusively** to the research-program.

---

## What MMS Is (Operative Definition)

The **Matrix Management System (MMS)** is the **operative implementation**
of the neutral research-program.

It is **not** an information system in the classical sense
and **not** a database for facts as truth.

MMS exists to do exactly one thing:

> **Manage epistemically structured statements
> under explicit rules of provenance, context, temporality, and conflict —
> without collapsing them into truth, consensus, or decision.**

Concretely, MMS:

- extracts **statements and fact claims** from sources
- binds each statement to explicit provenance
- preserves temporal context and versioning
- represents relationships between statements
- marks conflicts instead of resolving them
- enforces structural constraints defined by the research-program

MMS does **not** manage “knowledge” as validated truth.
It manages **claims about knowledge under assumptions**.

MMS implements **handling rules**, not **truth rules**.

---

## MMS as a System (Clarifying Analogy)

If compared to classical systems:

- MMS is **not** a DBMS for data
- MMS is **not** a knowledge base
- MMS is **not** an expert system

MMS can be understood as:

> **An operative management system for epistemic states
> (claims, assumptions, conflicts, provenance),
> designed to preserve disagreement instead of eliminating it.**

For this reason, MMS may be described as
a system for **structured dissensus**, not for resolution.

---

## What MMS Explicitly Is Not

MMS is **not**:

- a knowledge authority
- a decision-making system
- a recommendation engine
- a consensus mechanism
- an expert system
- a governance or policy framework
- a world model

MMS does **not**:

- decide what is true
- resolve conflicts
- rank sources by validity
- collapse disagreement into a single output
- produce normative or actionable guidance

Any system performing such functions
operates **outside** this architecture
and must assume **explicit, separate responsibility**.

---

## What the Matrix Is (Product Definition)

The **Matrix** is the **instantiated product**
generated by an MMS run.

It is a **structured, versioned, and conflict-aware representation**
of statements under explicit assumptions.

The Matrix:

- is contingent
- is revisable
- is incomplete by design
- may contain contradictions
- carries **no epistemic authority**

The Matrix represents **what is claimed, by whom, when,
under which assumptions, and in conflict with what**.

---

## What the Matrix Is Not

The Matrix is **not**:

- a reference truth
- a definitive knowledge base
- a canonical dataset
- a validated representation of reality
- a decision or recommendation system

The Matrix does **not** justify decisions.

Its sole purpose is to make
**disagreement, provenance, and context explicit**
so that decisions can be taken **elsewhere**,
under explicit responsibility.

---

## Responsibility Boundary

This repository bundle is responsible for:

- epistemic structure
- operative constraints
- transparency of assumptions
- auditability of process

It is **not** responsible for:

- decisions
- actions
- policies
- governance
- real-world outcomes

Any system consuming the Matrix
must explicitly re-establish
its own responsibility and authority model.

## Transition to the Reference Architecture

The **canonical fixation** of all terms, layers,
and responsibilities can be found in:

→ `2.ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Final Note

> This document describes **architecture and product line**,
> not the world.

It marks:
- where neutrality ends
- where responsibility begins
- and where counter-designs are explicitly intended.
