# RESEARCH PROGRAM — STATUS
## Structural Scope and Closure

---

## Status

The Research Program (RP) is **structurally complete**.

It is not under active expansion
and does not require further conceptual additions
to fulfill its role within the architecture.

---

## Active Structural Components

The following components of the RP
are **structurally binding**:

- ontological definitions of admissible entity types,
- structural constraints on existence and admissibility,
- explicit separation of roles (RP / MMS / Matrix),
- minimality constraint (Occam),
- explicit isolation of the normative starting point (Münchhausen),
- interface definitions to MMS.

These components define
what may exist in the Matrix
and how admissibility is enforced.

---

## Explorative and Historical Components

The RP also contains documents and sections
that are **explorative, historical, or heuristic** in nature.

These components:

- served to explore problem spaces,
- motivated structural decisions,
- tested conceptual boundaries,
- or document the development history of the program.

They are **closed** and **non-binding**.

They do not:

- define admissible structures,
- justify rules,
- introduce authority,
- or affect MMS enforcement.

---

## Authority Statement

Only documents explicitly defining
structural primitives, constraints,
or interfaces
are authoritative within the RP.

Explorative material carries
**no structural authority**.

No rule, schema, or admissibility condition
may be derived from exploration alone.

---

## Change Policy

Any modification of:

- admissible entity types,
- structural constraints,
- layer separation,
- or enforcement interfaces

constitutes a modification
of the Research Program itself
and must be treated explicitly as such.

Absent such modification,
the RP is considered **stable**.

---

## Final Note

The Research Program does not claim
to be final in any absolute sense.

It claims only that,
in its current form,
it is **sufficient** for the architecture it defines.

Further expansion is possible,
but not required.
