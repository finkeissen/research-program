# OCCAM
## Minimality as an Admissibility Boundary

---

## Status

This document defines a **heuristic constraint**
on the construction of this research program.

It is not a rule of truth,
not a principle of correctness,
and not an optimization criterion.

It binds only the **design of the architecture itself**.

---

## Occam’s Razor (Restricted Use)

Occam’s Razor is applied here
in its **weakest admissible form**:

> Do not introduce more structure
> than is required
> to prevent epistemic collapse.

No stronger claim is made.

---

## Scope of Application

Occam’s Razor applies only to:

- the number of admissibility rules,
- the number of layers,
- the number of schema elements,
- the number of permitted transitions.

It does **not** apply to:

- explanatory power,
- elegance,
- usefulness,
- completeness,
- empirical adequacy.

---

## Minimality Claim (Explicit)

The architecture presented here
claims only the following:

> This is the **simplest structure**
> found sufficient
> to block implicit authority,
> uncontrolled normativity,
> and epistemic layer collapse.

No claim is made
that this structure is optimal,
unique,
or final.

---

## Non-Comparative Nature

This use of Occam’s Razor
does not compare this architecture
to alternatives.

It states only that:

- removing any element
  reintroduces a known failure mode,
- adding any element
  requires new justification.

Minimality is asserted
**relative to identified failure modes**,
not relative to competing systems.

---

## Relation to Anti-Theory

The appeal to minimality
does not ground the system.

It constrains it.

If a simpler admissible structure
were demonstrated,
this program would be obligated
to contract.

---

## Final Note

Occam’s Razor is not used here
to claim superiority.

It is used to justify
**stopping further construction**.
