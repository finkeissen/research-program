# ORIGIN

## Naming and Conceptual Origin

The term **“Physics Effect”** is used in this repository
as a structural label for an epistemic necessity:

> constraints precede structure,  
> and structure precedes interpretation.

The naming is historically derived
from earlier conceptual work
published under the title *The Physics Effect*.

This repository does **not** assume,
import,
or rely on any claims,
arguments,
models,
or conclusions from that work.

The reference is **historical, not authoritative**.

All admissibility rules, guardrails,
and STOP conditions defined here
stand independently of their naming origin.

No element of this repository
derives legitimacy from the referenced publication.
