# MATRIX — APPLICATION
## Ethics and Morality Under Admissibility Constraint

---

## Status

This document applies the existing architecture
to ethical and moral discourse.

No moral theory is assumed.
No ethical authority is imported.

Only admissibility under the Research Program
is tested.

---

## Entry ETH-0001

### Problem

Implicit normativity of ethical reasoning.

---

### Symptom

Ethical arguments
are treated as binding guidance
rather than as normative proposals.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Moral reasoning
is mistaken for epistemic justification.

---

### Consequence

Normative authority
is introduced without responsibility assignment.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(individuals, communities, institutions).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of implicit moral authority.
- Freedom: explicit moral choice under responsibility.

---

## STOP RECORD ETH-S-0001

### Trigger

Attempt to derive obligation
from ethical argumentation alone.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitAuthority

---

### Result

STOP.
Ethical reasoning is not binding.

---

## Entry ETH-0002

### Problem

Universalization of moral claims.

---

### Symptom

Context-specific moral judgments
are presented as universally valid.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Desire for moral closure
and conflict elimination.

---

### Consequence

Suppression of plural moral frameworks.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(cultural, political, or individual).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: rejection of universal moral authority.
- Freedom: coexistence of incompatible moral commitments.

---

## STOP RECORD ETH-S-0002

### Trigger

Attempt to declare a moral claim
as universally binding.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ProhibitedContent

---

### Result

STOP.
Universal moral binding inadmissible.

---

## Entry ETH-0003

### Problem

Collapse between moral evaluation
and decision justification.

---

### Symptom

Moral approval
is treated as sufficient decision warrant.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Moral alignment
is mistaken for responsibility assignment.

---

### Consequence

Decisions appear justified
without explicit accountability.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(decision-makers, institutions).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: separation of moral judgment and decision authority.
- Freedom: explicit assumption of responsibility.

---

## Absence Zone ETH-A-0001

### Description

Final resolution of moral disagreement.

---

### Reason for Absence

- Resolution requires shared normative authority.
- No such authority is admissible internally.

---

### Result

No admissible representation.
Persistent disagreement recorded as absence.

---

## Structural Note

Ethics and morality are admissible
only as **expressions of normative positions**,
never as sources of binding authority.

---

## Final Note

This application does not deny morality.

It records where moral discourse
becomes inadmissible
as epistemic or operative authority.
