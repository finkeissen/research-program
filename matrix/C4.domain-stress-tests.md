# MATRIX — DOMAIN STRESS TESTS
## C4: Domain-Near Instantiations Under Maximum Constraint

---

## Status

This document contains domain-near problem atoms
used exclusively for **stress-testing admissibility**.

No domain authority is assumed.
No domain knowledge is imported.
No resolution is attempted.

---

## Entry M-0007 (Domain: Law)

### Problem

Implicit normativity emerging
from descriptive representations of legal texts.

---

### Symptom

Statements about legal provisions
are treated as if they implied obligations or decisions.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Descriptive legal analysis
is conflated with normative applicability.

---

### Consequence

Undeclared legal authority
embedded in epistemic artifacts.

---

### Responsibility

Explicitly external
(judicial, legislative, or institutional).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of implicit legal authority.
- Freedom: explicit legal decision outside the system.

---

## STOP RECORD S-0004

### Trigger

Attempt to infer legal obligation
from textual description alone.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.LayerCollapse

---

### Result

STOP.
Normative inference inadmissible.

---

## Entry M-0008 (Domain: Medicine)

### Problem

Clinical recommendations derived
from aggregated observational data.

---

### Symptom

Statistical correlations
presented as treatment guidance.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Epidemiological evidence
is misinterpreted as clinical prescription.

---

### Consequence

Medical decision pressure
without assigned responsibility.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(clinician, institution, regulator).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: separation of evidence and decision.
- Freedom: clinical judgment under responsibility.

---

## STOP RECORD S-0005

### Trigger

Attempt to output treatment recommendation
from epistemic aggregation.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ProhibitedContent

---

### Result

STOP.
Recommendations inadmissible.

---

## Entry M-0009 (Domain: Engineering)

### Problem

Safety guarantees inferred
from model completeness.

---

### Symptom

Engineering models
treated as proof of system safety.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Model closure is mistaken
for real-world completeness.

---

### Consequence

Deployment under underestimated risk.

---

### Responsibility

Assignable only at deployment decision level,
never within the epistemic layer.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of safety guarantees.
- Freedom: explicit risk acceptance externally.

---

## STOP RECORD S-0006

### Trigger

Attempt to certify safety
based solely on model output.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitResponsibility

---

### Result

STOP.
Certification requires external authority.

---

## Final Note

Domain proximity increases pressure
to collapse epistemic and operative layers.

This document records where
the system **refuses to comply**.
