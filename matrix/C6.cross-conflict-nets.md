# MATRIX — CROSS-CONFLICT NETS
## C6: Explicit Conflict Relations Without Resolution

---

## Status

This document introduces **explicit cross-conflict relations**
between existing Matrix entries.

It does not resolve conflicts,
prioritize them,
or propose trade-offs.

Conflicts are recorded as structural facts.

---

## Purpose

As the Matrix grows,
conflicts do not remain isolated.

This document makes visible
where multiple admissible problem atoms
intersect, interfere, or contradict each other.

---

## Conflict Net CN-0001

### Involved Entries

- M-0001 (Normative conclusions from structure)
- M-0004 (Overconfidence from formal completeness)
- M-0006 (Epistemic outputs used as decisions)

---

### Conflict Description

Formal structure simultaneously:

- discourages implicit normativity,
- induces confidence through completeness,
- and is reused as decision input.

These effects cannot be eliminated
without violating at least one admissibility rule.

---

### Conflict Type

Irreducible epistemic–operative tension.

---

### Resolution Status

None.
Resolution would require
external authority assignment.

---

## Conflict Net CN-0002

### Involved Entries

- M-0002 (Layer collapse in pipelines)
- M-0005 (Aggregation suppressing disagreement)
- S-0003 (STOP on narrative unification)

---

### Conflict Description

Operational pressure favors aggregation
to maintain pipeline continuity,
while admissibility requires
explicit preservation of conflict.

Both cannot be satisfied simultaneously
within the epistemic layer.

---

### Conflict Type

Structural incompatibility.

---

### Resolution Status

STOP applies at the point of attempted synthesis.

---

## Conflict Net CN-0003

### Involved Entries

- M-0007 (Implicit legal normativity)
- M-0008 (Clinical recommendations)
- M-0009 (Engineering safety guarantees)

---

### Conflict Description

Domain proximity increases expectation
of guidance, obligation, or certification.

Epistemic admissibility prohibits
all three within the Matrix.

The closer the domain,
the stronger the pressure to violate boundaries.

---

### Conflict Type

Domain-induced authority pressure.

---

### Resolution Status

No internal resolution admissible.
Explicit external handover required.

---

## Conflict Net CN-0004

### Involved Entries

- M-0003 (Münchhausen starting point)
- A-0005 (No self-evaluation of Matrix)
- SELF-APPLICATION.md (Structural self-plausibility)

---

### Conflict Description

The system requires a normative starting point
that cannot be justified internally,
while simultaneously prohibiting
self-evaluation or self-legitimation.

This tension cannot be dissolved
without invalidating the architecture.

---

### Conflict Type

Foundational self-reference conflict.

---

### Resolution Status

Explicitly unresolved.
Structural stability depends on non-resolution.

---

## Structural Note

Conflict nets do not form a hierarchy,
graph,
or optimization landscape.

They are overlapping regions
of persistent tension.

---

## Final Note

Conflicts recorded here
are not problems to be solved.

They are **conditions under which the system operates**.

Where conflicts disappear,
implicit authority has likely entered.
