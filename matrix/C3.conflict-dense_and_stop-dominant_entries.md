# MATRIX — ADDITIONAL INSTANTIATIONS
## C3: Conflict-Dense and STOP-Dominant Entries

---

## Status

This document extends the Matrix
through additional instantiations.

No attempt is made to balance,
resolve,
or contextualize entries.

---

## Entry M-0004

### Problem

Structural overconfidence induced
by formal completeness of representations.

---

### Symptom

High confidence outputs
despite acknowledged incompleteness
and unresolved conflicts.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Formal closure is mistaken
for epistemic closure.

---

### Consequence

Decisions taken under false certainty
without explicit responsibility.

---

### Responsibility

Not assignable within the epistemic layer.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of certainty without closure.
- Freedom: external judgment under explicit risk.

---

## Entry M-0005

### Problem

Suppression of disagreement
through representational aggregation.

---

### Symptom

Multiple incompatible claims
represented as a single synthesized position.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Pressure for usability and clarity
over faithful conflict representation.

---

### Consequence

Erasure of minority or incompatible positions.

---

### Responsibility

Assignable only to aggregation design choices,
not to individual claims.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: conflict preservation.
- Freedom: external synthesis under responsibility.

---

## Entry M-0006

### Problem

Inadmissible extension of epistemic outputs
into decision or policy domains.

---

### Symptom

Epistemic artifacts
used as direct decision inputs.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Lack of explicit boundary enforcement
between epistemic and operative layers.

---

### Consequence

Unacknowledged authority transfer.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable,
never internal to the Matrix.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: strict layer separation.
- Freedom: explicit handover outside the system.

---

## STOP RECORD S-0002

### Trigger

Attempt to rank problem atoms
by relevance, urgency, or impact.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ProhibitedContent

---

### Result

STOP.
Ranking is inadmissible at the Matrix level.

---

## STOP RECORD S-0003

### Trigger

Attempt to merge conflicting causes
into a unified explanatory narrative.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.LayerCollapse

---

### Result

STOP.
Conflict preservation required.

---

## Final Note

Growth of the Matrix
does not imply progress,
coverage,
or convergence.

It implies only
that admissible instantiations
were possible.
