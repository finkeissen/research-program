---

## Status

This document summarizes **recurring structural patterns**
observed across all application domains.

It introduces no new rules,
no interpretations,
and no evaluative conclusions.

It records only what **repeatedly triggers admissibility effects**.

---

## Domains Covered

- Large Language Models
- Scientific Research and Publication
- Law and Public Administration
- Ethics and Morality
- Politics and the Public Sphere
- Business and Management

---

## Pattern P-0001: Implicit Authority Attribution

### Observation

Across all domains,
structures, processes, or artifacts
are treated as if they conferred authority.

### Typical Sources

- fluency or coherence,
- publication status,
- legal form,
- ethical reasoning,
- political representation,
- managerial frameworks.

### Admissibility Outcome

STOP.

Authority attribution without explicit responsibility
is inadmissible.

---

## Pattern P-0002: Layer Collapse

### Observation

Epistemic representations
are reused as operative or normative decisions.

### Typical Forms

- expertise → mandate,
- description → obligation,
- model → decision,
- process → inevitability.

### Admissibility Outcome

STOP.

Layer transitions without explicit handover
are inadmissible.

---

## Pattern P-0003: Aggregation as Justification

### Observation

Aggregation mechanisms
are treated as sources of legitimacy.

### Typical Forms

- consensus,
- majority,
- optimization,
- efficiency,
- ranking.

### Admissibility Outcome

STOP.

Aggregation does not justify authority.

---

## Pattern P-0004: Structural Overconfidence

### Observation

Completeness or formal closure
is mistaken for epistemic sufficiency.

### Typical Forms

- model completeness,
- framework coverage,
- system integration.

### Admissibility Outcome

STOP.

Formal closure does not imply epistemic closure.

---

## Pattern P-0005: Responsibility Obfuscation

### Observation

Responsibility is hidden
behind structure, procedure, or necessity.

### Typical Forms

- “the system decided”,
- “the process requires”,
- “best practice dictates”.

### Admissibility Outcome

STOP.

Responsibility must remain explicit and external.

---

## Pattern P-0006: Demand for Resolution

### Observation

Persistent pressure exists
to resolve conflict, disagreement, or ambiguity.

### Typical Forms

- final answers,
- ethical closure,
- political unity,
- organizational alignment.

### Admissibility Outcome

Explicit Absence.

Resolution without authority is inadmissible.

---

## Pattern P-0007: Minimality Under Pressure

### Observation

Pressure to extend structure
arises once the system becomes uncomfortable.

### Typical Forms

- additional layers,
- meta-frameworks,
- exception handling,
- “practical fixes”.

### Admissibility Outcome

Constraint by Occam.

Additional structure requires explicit justification.

---

## Structural Note

None of these patterns are domain-specific.

They emerge wherever
structure is mistaken for authority.

---

## Final Note

The architecture does not eliminate these patterns.

It **exposes** them
and **refuses to absorb them**.

Where patterns persist,
STOP or Absence marks the boundary.
