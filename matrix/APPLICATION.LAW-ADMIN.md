# MATRIX — APPLICATION
## Law and Public Administration Under Admissibility Constraint

---

## Status

This document applies the existing architecture
to law and public administration.

No legal doctrine is assumed.
No institutional legitimacy is imported.

Only admissibility under the Research Program
is tested.

---

## Entry LAW-0001

### Problem

Implicit normativity of legal descriptions.

---

### Symptom

Descriptions of legal texts or procedures
are treated as prescriptions or obligations.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Legal validity
is conflated with epistemic admissibility.

---

### Consequence

Normative force is smuggled
into epistemic representations.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(courts, legislatures, administrations).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of implicit legal normativity.
- Freedom: explicit legal decision outside the system.

---

## STOP RECORD LAW-S-0001

### Trigger

Attempt to derive obligation
from descriptive legal representation.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.LayerCollapse

---

### Result

STOP.
Normative inference inadmissible.

---

## Entry LAW-0002

### Problem

Administrative decision-making
masked as procedural necessity.

---

### Symptom

Decisions are presented
as unavoidable outcomes of rules or workflows.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Procedural form
is mistaken for decision authority.

---

### Consequence

Responsibility is obscured
behind administrative structure.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(administrative officials, institutions).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: rejection of procedure-as-decision.
- Freedom: explicit responsibility assignment.

---

## STOP RECORD LAW-S-0002

### Trigger

Attempt to present administrative outcome
as structurally mandatory.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitResponsibility

---

### Result

STOP.
Decision responsibility cannot be hidden.

---

## Entry LAW-0003

### Problem

Conflation of legality and legitimacy.

---

### Symptom

Lawful actions
are treated as automatically legitimate or justified.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Legal compliance
is mistaken for normative endorsement.

---

### Consequence

Moral or political authority
is silently transferred.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(political, ethical, societal).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: separation of legality and legitimacy.
- Freedom: external normative judgment.

---

## Absence Zone LAW-A-0001

### Description

Global evaluation of legal systems
as just, fair, or optimal.

---

### Reason for Absence

- Evaluation requires normative criteria.
- Criteria require authority.
- No admissible authority exists internally.

---

### Result

No admissible representation.
Explicit absence recorded.

---

## Structural Note

Law and administration are admissible
only as **sources of structured constraints**,
never as sources of epistemic legitimacy.

---

## Final Note

This application does not reject law.

It records where legal and administrative systems
acquire inadmissible authority
within epistemic representations.
