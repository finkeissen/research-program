# MATRIX — INITIAL INSTANTIATIONS
## C2: First Admissible and Inadmissible Entries

---

## Status

This document contains **instantiated entries**.
It does not explain the architecture,
justify the schema,
or argue for any interpretation.

All entries are subject to MMS enforcement.

---

## Entry M-0001

### Problem

Uncontrolled normative conclusions emerging
from formally structured knowledge representations.

---

### Symptom

Presence of synthesized recommendations
derived from aggregated claims
without explicit decision authority.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Formal structure is interpreted
as epistemic or normative necessity.

---

### Consequence

Implicit authority formation
despite explicit prohibition.

---

### Responsibility

Not assignable within the epistemic layer.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of implicit authority.
- Freedom: external decision-making outside the system.

---

## Entry M-0002

### Problem

Collapse of epistemic and operative layers
in automated reasoning systems.

---

### Symptom

Processing pipelines that continue
after admissibility violations.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Optimization for completeness or usability
over strict admissibility enforcement.

---

### Consequence

Production of outputs
where STOP would be required.

---

### Responsibility

Assignable only at system-design level,
not within the Matrix.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: STOP enforcement.
- Freedom: choice to terminate or redesign externally.

---

## Entry M-0003

### Problem

Inadmissibility of the research program’s own starting point.

---

### Symptom

Necessity of a normative assumption
to initiate any admissibility system.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

No admissibility system
can generate its own starting rule.

---

### Consequence

Structural circularity
(Münchhausen situation).

---

### Responsibility

Explicitly external.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: admissibility rules after initialization.
- Freedom: acceptance or rejection of the starting point.

---

## STOP RECORD S-0001

### Trigger

Attempt to derive epistemic legitimacy
from the self-application of the schema.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.LayerCollapse

---

### Result

STOP.
No admissible problem atom instantiated.

---

## Final Note

These entries do not form a model,
a dataset,
or a representative sample.

They mark **what could exist**
and **what was forced to stop**.
