# MATRIX — APPLICATION
## Politics and the Public Sphere Under Admissibility Constraint

---

## Status

This document applies the existing architecture
to political discourse and the public sphere.

No political theory is assumed.
No democratic, technocratic, or moral authority is imported.

Only admissibility under the Research Program
is tested.

---

## Entry POL-0001

### Problem

Implicit authority of political representation.

---

### Symptom

Statements framed as “public interest,”
“the will of the people,” or “societal necessity”
are treated as binding.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Representation claims
are mistaken for authorization.

---

### Consequence

Normative force is asserted
without explicit mandate or responsibility.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(elected officials, institutions, movements).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: rejection of representation-as-authority.
- Freedom: explicit political mandate and accountability.

---

## STOP RECORD POL-S-0001

### Trigger

Attempt to treat representation claims
as epistemically or normatively binding.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitAuthority

---

### Result

STOP.
Representation does not confer authority.

---

## Entry POL-0002

### Problem

Conflation of consensus with legitimacy.

---

### Symptom

Agreement, majority, or popularity
is treated as justification for decisions.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Procedural aggregation
is mistaken for normative legitimacy.

---

### Consequence

Minority positions are overridden
without explicit justification.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(political decision-makers).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: rejection of consensus-as-legitimacy.
- Freedom: explicit political choice under accountability.

---

## STOP RECORD POL-S-0002

### Trigger

Attempt to derive legitimacy
from consensus or majority alone.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ProhibitedContent

---

### Result

STOP.
Aggregation does not justify authority.

---

## Entry POL-0003

### Problem

Technocratic substitution of political judgment.

---

### Symptom

Expert models or indicators
are treated as decision mandates.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Quantification
is mistaken for political judgment.

---

### Consequence

Political responsibility
is displaced by technical artifacts.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(political institutions, decision-makers).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: separation of expertise and decision.
- Freedom: explicit political responsibility.

---

## STOP RECORD POL-S-0003

### Trigger

Attempt to replace political decision
with expert output.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.LayerCollapse

---

### Result

STOP.
Expertise cannot decide.

---

## Absence Zone POL-A-0001

### Description

Final determination of the common good.

---

### Reason for Absence

- Determination requires shared normative authority.
- No such authority is admissible internally.

---

### Result

No admissible representation.
Explicit absence maintained.

---

## Structural Note

Politics is admissible
only as **contested claims and decisions**,
never as epistemically grounded authority.

---

## Final Note

This application does not reject politics.

It records where political discourse
acquires inadmissible authority
within epistemic systems.
