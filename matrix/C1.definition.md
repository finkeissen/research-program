# MATRIX — DEFINITION
## C1: Matrix as an Implementation Layer

---

## Status

This document defines the **Matrix**
as an **implementation and instantiation layer**
within the overall architecture.

It does **not** introduce ontological primitives.

All structural entity types referenced here
are defined in the Research Program,
specifically in:

- `research-program/MATRIX-STRUCTURE.md`

This document restates their role
at the level of implementation only.

---

## Role of the Matrix

The Matrix is the **existence record**
of this architecture.

It contains only concrete instantiations
of structures defined
by the Research Program
and admitted by MMS.

The Matrix has no authority
to define, modify, or extend structure.

---

## What Exists in the Matrix

The Matrix may contain only
instances of the following
structural entity types
(as defined in the Research Program):

1. Problem Atoms
2. Relations
3. Conflict Markers
4. STOP Records
5. Absence Records
6. Provenance Metadata

No additional entity types are permitted.

---

## What the Matrix Is Not

The Matrix is not:

- a knowledge base,
- a rule system,
- a schema definition,
- a decision-support mechanism,
- a theory or model of reality.

Any such interpretation
constitutes a structural violation.

---

## Existence Conditions

An entity exists in the Matrix
if and only if:

- its entity type is defined in the Research Program,
- it satisfies the problem-atom schema (if applicable),
- it has been admitted by MMS,
- no STOP condition applies.

Existence is binary:
- instantiated,
- or refused (STOP / Absence).

---

## Time and Revision

The Matrix is time-indexed
and revision-aware.

New entries do not overwrite old ones.
They coexist,
conflict,
or terminate through STOP.

No convergence is assumed.

---

## Authority

The Matrix has **no internal authority**.

All structural authority resides
in the Research Program.

All enforcement authority resides
in MMS.

The Matrix defines no structure.
MMS enforces admissibility
but introduces no structures of its own.

---

## Final Note

The Matrix does not define
what may exist.

It records
what was allowed to exist.
