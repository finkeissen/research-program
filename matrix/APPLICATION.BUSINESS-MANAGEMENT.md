# MATRIX — APPLICATION
## Business and Management Under Admissibility Constraint

---

## Status

This document applies the existing architecture
to business, management, and organizational practice.

No management theory is assumed.
No market, shareholder, or efficiency authority is imported.

Only admissibility under the Research Program
is tested.

---

## Entry BUS-0001

### Problem

Implicit authority of management frameworks.

---

### Symptom

Frameworks, best practices, or methodologies
are treated as decision mandates.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Formalization
is mistaken for organizational authority.

---

### Consequence

Decisions appear justified
without explicit responsibility assignment.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(managers, boards, owners).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: rejection of framework-as-authority.
- Freedom: explicit managerial decision under accountability.

---

## STOP RECORD BUS-S-0001

### Trigger

Attempt to treat a management framework
as a binding decision rule.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitAuthority

---

### Result

STOP.
Frameworks do not decide.

---

## Entry BUS-0002

### Problem

Conflation of efficiency with legitimacy.

---

### Symptom

Efficiency metrics
are treated as sufficient justification
for organizational decisions.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Quantitative optimization
is mistaken for normative warrant.

---

### Consequence

Value judgments are hidden
behind performance indicators.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(executive decision-makers).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: separation of efficiency and legitimacy.
- Freedom: explicit value choice under responsibility.

---

## STOP RECORD BUS-S-0002

### Trigger

Attempt to justify a decision
solely by efficiency metrics.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ProhibitedContent

---

### Result

STOP.
Efficiency does not confer legitimacy.

---

## Entry BUS-0003

### Problem

Delegation of responsibility to process.

---

### Symptom

Organizational outcomes
are presented as unavoidable results
of workflows or governance structures.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Process compliance
is mistaken for decision ownership.

---

### Consequence

Responsibility is diffused or obscured.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(organizational leadership).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: prohibition of process-as-decision.
- Freedom: explicit assumption of responsibility.

---

## STOP RECORD BUS-S-0003

### Trigger

Attempt to present a decision
as structurally inevitable.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitResponsibility

---

### Result

STOP.
Decisions cannot be hidden in process.

---

## Absence Zone BUS-A-0001

### Description

Global optimization of organizational goals.

---

### Reason for Absence

- Optimization requires value prioritization.
- Prioritization requires authority.
- No admissible authority exists internally.

---

### Result

No admissible representation.
Explicit absence maintained.

---

## Structural Note

Business and management artifacts
are admissible only as **decision inputs**,
never as decision authorities.

---

## Final Note

This application does not reject management.

It records where managerial discourse
acquires inadmissible authority
within epistemic systems.
