# MATRIX — APPLICATION
## Scientific Research and Publication Under Admissibility Constraint

---

## Status

This document applies the existing architecture
to scientific research and publication practices.

No scientific norms are assumed.
No methodological authority is imported.

Only admissibility under the Research Program
is tested.

---

## Entry SCI-0001

### Problem

Implicit authority of published results.

---

### Symptom

Peer-reviewed publication
is treated as epistemic legitimacy
rather than as a procedural filter.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Publication status
is conflated with truth status.

---

### Consequence

Authority is transferred
from process to content.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(publishers, institutions, communities).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: rejection of publication-as-legitimacy.
- Freedom: external trust decisions under responsibility.

---

## STOP RECORD SCI-S-0001

### Trigger

Attempt to treat publication
as epistemic authorization.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ImplicitAuthority

---

### Result

STOP.
Publication status inadmissible as authority.

---

## Entry SCI-0002

### Problem

Normative pressure toward positive results.

---

### Symptom

Negative or inconclusive results
are filtered out or underreported.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: observed)*

Incentive structures
favor significance over admissibility.

---

### Consequence

Systematic distortion
of the epistemic record.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable
(institutional incentive design).

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: admissibility independent of outcome.
- Freedom: external reward structures.

---

## STOP RECORD SCI-S-0002

### Trigger

Attempt to rank research contributions
by impact, novelty, or significance.

---

### Violated Rule

SchemaViolation.ProhibitedContent

---

### Result

STOP.
Ranking inadmissible at the epistemic layer.

---

## Entry SCI-0003

### Problem

Collapse between explanation and confirmation.

---

### Symptom

Explanatory narratives
are treated as confirmation evidence.

---

### Cause  
*(epistemic status: assumed)*

Narrative coherence
is mistaken for empirical support.

---

### Consequence

Overconfidence in explanatory models.

---

### Responsibility

Externally assignable.

---

### Freedom / Binding Tension

- Binding: separation of explanation and confirmation.
- Freedom: external theory preference.

---

## Absence Zone SCI-A-0001

### Description

Global assessment of scientific progress,
quality, or convergence.

---

### Reason for Absence

- Assessment requires criteria.
- Criteria require authority.
- No admissible authority exists internally.

---

### Result

No admissible representation.
Explicit absence maintained.

---

## Structural Note

Scientific practice is admissible
only as a source of **claims**,
not as a source of **authority**.

All legitimacy remains external.

---

## Final Note

This application does not criticize science.

It records where scientific practices
acquire inadmissible authority
within epistemic systems.
