## How to Read the Matrix in 15 Minutes

### Purpose

The Matrix is not a model and not a decision system.  
It is a **constraint surface**.

It shows where structural assumptions  
trigger admissibility effects  
(STOP or Absence).

It does not evaluate outcomes.  
It evaluates **structural transitions**.

---

### Step 1 — Start with Structure, not Content (≈ 3 min)

Ignore domain specifics at first.

Look only for:
- entity types,
- layer assignments,
- interfaces,
- transitions.

If something acts across layers  
without an explicit interface,  
you are already close to a STOP condition.

---

### Step 2 — Identify the Claim Type (≈ 3 min)

For any statement, ask:
- Is this **descriptive**?
- **epistemic**?
- **normative**?
- **operative**?

If the claim moves between these  
without an explicit handover,  
mark the transition.

That transition — not the claim —  
is what the Matrix evaluates.

---

### Step 3 — Check for Authority Substitution (≈ 3 min)

Ask a single question:

> Who is responsible if this is wrong?

If the answer is:
- “the model”,
- “the process”,
- “the system”,
- “the consensus”,

then responsibility has collapsed into structure.

This typically triggers  
**Pattern P-0001 or P-0005**.

---

### Step 4 — Watch for Aggregation Pressure (≈ 3 min)

Be alert when aggregation is treated as justification.

Typical signals:
- “most experts agree”,
- “the optimal solution”,
- “the efficient outcome”,
- “the majority decided”.

Aggregation may inform analysis.  
It never confers authority.

If aggregation replaces explicit responsibility,  
STOP applies.

---

### Step 5 — Accept Non-Resolution (≈ 3 min)

If conflict, ambiguity, or tension persists  
after structural clarification,
do not attempt to resolve it.

Persistent disagreement often indicates:
- missing authority,
- incompatible layers,
- or illegitimate closure pressure.

In such cases,  
**Absence is the correct outcome**.

---

### Final Orientation

The Matrix does not tell you what to do.

It tells you:
- where you may not proceed,
- where responsibility must be made explicit,
- and where structure must stop.

If nothing triggers STOP or Absence,
the Matrix remains silent.

Silence is not approval.
It is admissibility.
